georgia gulf said it *has* n't eliminated any alternatives and that d*is*cussions *are* being held with interested parties and work is also continuing on other various transactions
analysts saw the latest offer as proof that mr. simmons an aggressive and pers*is*tent investor wo n't leave georgia gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed
he *appears* to be in it for the long haul
mr. simmons and nl already *own* a N N stake in georgia gulf
mr. simmons **owns** N N of valhi inc. which in turn owns two-thirds of nl
nl *is* officially making the offer
now he said the group *plans* to put in several hundred million dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt
mr. martin said they *have* n't yet decided what their next move would be but he did n't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing georgia gulf 's board
in other transactions *mr.* simmons *has* followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer
although georgia gulf *has* n't been eager to negotiate with mr. simmons and nl a specialty chemicals concern the group apparently *believes* the company 's management *is* interested in some kind of transaction

those efforts *are* being stepped up

mr. baldwin *is* also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers

that *has* been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than N N
in the past they *say* the strongest dividend growth *has* often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over
that pattern *has* n't always held but recent strong growth in dividends *makes* some market watchers anxious
payouts on the s&p N stocks rose N N in N according to standard & poor 's corp. and wall street estimates for N growth *are* generally between N N and N N
many people *believe* the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority *see* double-digit gains continuing
put another way the decline in the yield *suggests* stocks *have* gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they *pay* some market analysts *say*
they *are* keeping a close watch on the yield on the s&p N
the figure *is* currently about N N up from N N before the recent market slide
a drop below that N N benchmark *has* always been a strong warning sign that stocks *are* fully valued *says* mr. boesel of t. rowe price
and in each case he *says* a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year
still some market analysts *say* the current N N reading *is* n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past
so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they *are* not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength
painewebber inc. for instance *is* forecasting growth in s&p N dividends of just under N N in N down from an estimated N N this year
those dividend *bulls* *argue* that corporations *are* in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures
one indicator investors might want to watch *is* the monthly tally from standard & poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends
in any case opinion *is* mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth *continues* at double-digit levels
mr. einhorn of goldman sachs *estimates* the stock market will deliver a N N to N N total return from appreciation and dividends over the next N months vs. a cash rate of return of perhaps N N or N N if dividend growth *is* weak
but mr. boesel of t. rowe price who also *expects* N N growth in dividends next year *does* n't think it will help the overall market all that much
having the dividend *increases* *is* a supportive element in the market outlook but i *do* n't think it *'s* a main consideration he *says*
such *is* hardly the case
th*is* is where bell 's patents went
the ailing company which *has* reported net losses for N consecutive quarters said it wo n't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force

the company which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its series a convertible preferred stock said it *has* hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash

index-arbitrage trading *is* something we *want* to watch closely an official at london 's stock exchange said
we *do* n't think there *is* cause for concern at the moment
first the trading **is** done over the counter and is n't reported on either the u.s. or london stock trading tapes
in addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties *do* n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee
britain *has* two main index-arbitrage instruments
a financial times-stock exchange 100-share index option contract *is* traded on the london stock exchange 's traded options market

nekoosa **has** given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction mr. hahn has n't faced in his N earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes
we *are* prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he *says*
but a takeover battle *opens* up the possibility of a bidding war with all that implies
if a competitor *enters* the game for example mr. hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival

the agreement on poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which *has* already provoked veto threats by the white house and *is* sharply confined under this year 's budget
and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday *is* significant recent experience with a similar program in central america *indicates* that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively
the house and senate *are* divided over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase *is* itself significant
the funding *is* attached to an estimated $ N billion transportation bill that *goes* next to the senate and *carries* with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all u.s. domestic airline flights

while the senate commerce committee **has** approved legislation similar to the house bill on airline leveraged buy-outs the measure has n't yet come to the full floor
although the leg*is*lation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed at giving the transportation department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt
you now may drop by the voice of america offices in washington and read the text of what the voice *is* broadcasting to those N million people around the world who *tune* in to it each week

for a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling the united states information agency which *runs* the voice changed its position on three key points
i had sought in my suit the right to print voice material which had been denied me and i had sought a right to receive the information arguing in effect that a right to print government information *is* n't very helpful if i *have* no right to get the information
so now the situation *is* this
you *have* a right to read voice of america scripts if you *do* n't mind traveling to washington every week or so and visiting the voice office during business hours
but neither of us can copy the material on a xerox machine or *have* it sent to us
in an era when every government agency *has* a public-relations machine that *sends* you *stuff* whether you *want* it or not this *does* seem odd
indeed judge o'brien ruled that it would be easy to conclude that the usia *'s* position *is* inappropriate or even stupid but it 's the law
so the next step i *suspect* *is* to try to get the law changed
we *i* *assume* you *'re* in this with me at this point need to get three words for examination only eliminated from the law
section N of the united states information and educational exchange act of N *says* voice material shall be available to certain of us but now thanks to the usia 's new position all of us for examination only

th*is* phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress
the appropriations *clause* states that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law
it *is* not supported by the text or history of the constitution
such laws *violate* the provision in article ii that *requires* the president to make recommendations to congress but which *gives* the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations
what *becomes* custom in the bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents including democrats to undo
however the president *does* have a duty not to violate the constitution
the question **is** whether his only means of defense is the veto
if congress *does* nothing president bush will have won
if congress *takes* the dispute to the supreme court assuming it can establish standing to sue president bush might win

if you 'd really rather *have* a buick *do* n't leave home without the american express card
american express co. and general motors *corp.* 's beleaguered buick division *are* joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the american express card
they *have* begun sending letters explaining the program which began oct. N and will end dec. N to about five million card holders
buick approached american express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally *have* a good credit history and *are* good at making payments *says* a spokeswoman for the division
american express also *represents* the upscale image we *'re* trying to project she *adds*
buick *has* been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as the doctor 's car a product for upscale professionals
but since the N model year began oct. N buick sales *have* plunged N N
for american express the promotion *is* part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales where the company *expects* to get much of the future growth in its card business
traditionally the card *has* been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses
to that end american express *has* been signing up gasoline companies car repair shops tire companies and car dealers to accept the card
but gmac approved the buick program he *says* because the american express green card *requires* payment in full upon billing and so *does* n't carry any finance rates
when the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases *buick* came in fourth among u.s. cars and in the top N of all cars the spokeswoman *says*
american express *has* more than N million card holders in the u.s. and over half *have* the green card
these N million people also *are* eligible to get one percentage point off gmac 's advertised finance rates which *start* at N N for two-year loan contracts

to keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives traders must seize every opportunity their computers *find*
but many experts and traders *say* that program trading *is* n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations
*says* the big board 's mr. phelan volatility *is* greater than program trading
traditional stock *manage*rs like to charge N cents to N cents for every $ N they manage for big institutional investors and higher fees for smaller investors
these small but influential floor brokers long *have* earned fat returns of N N to N N a year on their capital by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks

the buyers *walk* away and the special*is*t is left alone as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he *contends*
no one *is* more unhappy with program trading than the nation 's stockbrokers
they *are* still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the N stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then
stockbrokers ' business and pay *has* been falling
too much money *is* at stake for program traders to give up

program traders ' power to create total panic *is* so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way *says* rep. edward markey a massachusetts democrat

program trading *is* here to stay and computers *are* here to stay and we just need to understand it
currently margins on stock futures purchases *are* much lower roughly N N compared with N N for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative
program trading critics also *want* the federal reserve board rather than the futures industry to set such margins
futures traders *respond* that low margins *help* keep their markets active
higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who *help* larger traders *buy* and *sell* they *say*

index arbitrage *is* a common form of program trading
in index arbitrage the widget **is** the s&p N and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets largely in new york

that *represents* a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers *claim* to seek as their performance objective

an index-arbitrage trade **is** never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago to cover all transaction costs
a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he *sells* his futures
why *does* this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york
perhaps he *is* willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade
in a competitive market th*is* investor *has* many ways to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives both foreign and domestic if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle
the ultimate goal of any investor *is* a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors *are* sufficiently focused on the long term
in point of fact volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements *has* frequently been much higher than it *is* today
how *does* a nice new tax *say* N N on any financial transaction sound
that ought to make sure we *'re* all thinking for the long term
they continually *advise* their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell while their clients *continue* to hope for superior performance
almost all new regulation **is** introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences
if spreads available from index arbitrage *are* so enormous surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors
so what *is* next for program trading
spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor *chooses* arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit
some democrats in congress *are* warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years
the funding mechan*is*m which *has* received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by president bush would affect the antitrust operations of the justice department and the federal trade commission
to offset the reduction congress approved a $ N fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they *make* required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers acquisitions and certain other transactions
some democrats led by rep. jack *brooks* d. texas unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they *fear* that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts
but justice department and ftc officials said they *expect* the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them
when you *do* that there **is** not a cut but there is in fact a program increase of $ N million each for the ftc and the justice department rep. neal smith d. iowa said during house debate

he *adds* the market may be giving us another message that a recession *is* looming

mr. bush *has* said he would like to be able to use this procedure
but the two legal experts responding to an inquiry by sen. edward kennedy d. mass. wrote in a joint letter that the president *lacks* the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto
sen. kennedy said in a separate statement that he *supports* legislation to give the president line-item veto power but that it would be a reckless course of action for president bush to claim the authority without congressional approval

the vast majority of the u.s. corn crop now *is* grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies
a similar technique *is* almost impossible to apply to other crops such as cotton soybeans and rice

already the consequences *are* being felt by other players in the financial markets even governments
unwilling to put up new money for new zealand until those debts *are* repaid most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing forcing an embarrassed nomura to postpone it this week
aside from nomura 's injured pride the biggest victim so far *has* been the new zealand government
it may very well be what the japanese banks *want* he told radio new zealand
no less significant than the japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government *are* the implications of a confrontation between japan securities and banking industries

analysts *expect* ford will make the first move perhaps today with an initial offer of about N pence $ N a share
such a proposal *values* jaguar at more than # N billion $ N billion
speculation about a takeover fight *has* sent jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks
ford *is* in the driving seat at the moment observed bob barber an auto analyst at brokers james *capel* & *co*
but it *is* n't clear how long gm would be willing to fight ford for jaguar
jaguar officials in the u.s. noted that ford as jaguar 's largest shareholder now *has* the power to call for such a meeting
u.s. auto analysts also noted that ford *is* in the best position to benefit from the large number of jaguar shares that *have* moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid
jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid **are** weakened analysts *add* because fewer than N N of its shares are owned by employees and management

aside from europe the pacific div*is*ion is where coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come
in countries such as taiwan south korea and singapore economies *are* growing resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks
a coca-cola spokesman said it *is* too early to say how the joint venture would be structured or how much the company would invest in the transaction
in the past however coke *has* typically taken a minority stake in such ventures
that *does* n't appear to be the case in singapore a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate a key indicator of coke 's success in a market
a coke spokesman said he could n't say whether that *is* the direction of the talks

moody 's investors *service* inc. said it lowered the ratings on about $ N billion of houston lighting & power co. 's securities because of the company 's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation

however it *does* n't give much of a clue as to whether a recession *is* on the horizon
so far this year the index of leading indicators *has* risen in four months fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month
although september 's weakness followed two strong months for home sales the decline *supports* other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year *has* had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market
because the figures *are* based on a small sample the department said it *is* N N confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between N N and N N during the month
the department also said it *takes* four months to establish a trend
so far this year N newly built homes *have* been sold down N N from the like months of N
the commerce department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index the influence of this component *has* been reduced
several components that *track* the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in september
these *include* new orders for manufactured consumer goods *lead* times on vendor deliveries orders for new plant and equipment and backlogs of orders for durable goods
meanwhile the national association of manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of N executives on its board found that N N *do* n't expect a recession to occur until N or later
the remainder *expect* a downturn to begin sometime in
all the figures *are* adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns

another fight *is* brewing between congress and the bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit
in a hearing before the house ways and *means* committee the general accounting office and the congressional budget office which both *are* arms of congress advised the new s&l bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget
officials of the resolution trust corp. *have* said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout
the rtc *has* projected that it will require between $ N billion to $ N billion in temporary working capital
the borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts *are* sold
the new s&l law *allows* the rtc to issue notes for as much as N N of the value of the assets it *holds*
the new s&l bailout law *allows* $ N billion to be spent to sell or merge sick s&ls and their assets but that *is* a net cost
then the short-term debt *is* paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets
david mullins *ass*is*tant* secretary of the treasury said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions
if working capital financing *is* not provided he said the rtc may have to slow s&l sales or dump acquired assets through fire sales
it *'s* an overwhelming job she *says*

healthcare *has* given healthvest a N N note for that overdue amount to be repaid over three years
because healthcare actually *owes* healthvest $ N million in rent and mortgage payments each month the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note
a spokesman said healthvest *has* paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in october and *is* in negotiations with the third bank
the loan *is* backed by healthcare 's N N stake in healthvest and interest in certain facilities
some of the allegations *are* simply bizarre

the steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the u.s. *has* even triggered talk of building up a similar market here
industrial bank of japan which *claims* to be the biggest japanese buyer of u.s. mortgage securities *says* it will more than double its purchases this year to an amount one official *puts* at several billion dollars
this year some investors *are* changing their policies and investing a lot
ultimately he *says* strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities
at the moment nomura *is* the only japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of fannie mae instruments
these securities *are* attractive to japanese investors for three reasons
first they *are* safe
while they **are** n't backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government as treasury bonds are it *is* widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary
u.s. treasury bonds *are* still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term japanese investors
second they *are* liquid
the secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now *exceeds* $ N billion or nearly half of the $ N trillion in u.s. residential mortgages issued
third they *offer* high yields
at the moment some *offer* as much as N to N percentage points over treasury securities of similar maturities
but japanese institutional investors *are* used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems
since N japanese investors *have* bought nearly N N of $ N billion in *fannie* mae corporate debt issued to foreigners money that fannie mae uses to buy mortgages from u.s. banks
in addition further packaging of mortgage-backed securities such as blackstone 's fund *have* reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions *do* n't have to
freddie mac for years *has* offered a so-called participation certificate that *guarantees* it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of years and *offers* semiannual payments
however these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation 's directors if they *approve* of a bidder
supporters of poison pills *argue* that their adoption *forces* bidders to negotiate with a corporation 's directors who *are* thereby put in a better position to pursue the long-term interests of the corporation
these critics *are* backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills *reduces* shareholder values not merely in the short run but also over longer periods
institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis *are* interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill

on balance we *think* it will be positive
but some japanese government officials and businessmen *worry* that the prominent purchase *is* just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being
officially *yes* we *encourage* the free flow of direct investment *says* a foreign ministry official
many japanese companies *have* taken the warnings by the country 's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties
but to mitsubishi estate the acquisition *has* just the elements that should win support from both sides
first of all it *is* a friendly acquisition in which rockefeller sought out mitsubishi estate and asked it to buy a majority share
finally mitsubishi estate *has* no plans to interfere with rockefeller 's management beyond taking a place on the board
in asset terms *mitsub*is*hi* estate is the largest real estate firm in japan
mitsub*is*hi estate is one of the dozens of companies in today 's mitsubishi group
rockefeller *is* n't the first overseas purc*has*e for mitsubishi estate it has already played a leading role in designing los angeles 's citicorp plaza
but the rockefeller investment *is* its largest
moreover as a member of the mitsub**is**hi group which is headed by one of japan 's largest banks it is sure to win a favorable loan

the warner bros. studio and sony signaled they *are* close to a settlement yesterday asking a los *angeles* superior court to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on warner 's request for a preliminary injunction blocking mr. guber and mr. peters from taking the top posts at columbia pictures entertainment inc
in separate statements the two sides said they *want* to have further discussions
sony *is* acquiring columbia and guber-peters entertainment co. in two separate transactions valued at more than $ N billion
warner *has* a five-year exclusive contract with mr. guber and mr. peters that *requires* them to make movies exclusively at the warner bros. studio
but the people familiar with the talks said that warner *is* n't expected to get any cash in the settlement
instead sony *is* likely to agree to let warner participate in certain of its businesses such as the record club of sony 's cbs records unit
the two sides *are* also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to columbia 's movies
one for example came from cbs records chairman *walter* yetnikoff who will head a committee that will oversee sony 's entertainment division including both records and movies
but both sides *appear* to be more willing now to meet each other 's terms to resolve the issue
any settlement *is* also expected to exclude mr. guber and mr. peters from any of the projects they were working on at warner
but that *does* n't mean mr. guber and mr. peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects studios *develop* hundreds of movies but *produce* only N to N each year
once a studio *chooses* not to actually make a movie that *is* in development producers *are* typically free to take it elsewhere
but in acquiring guber-peters entertainment sony will actually get a piece of the profits from batman since the publicly held concern *gets* certain revenue from the movies *mr.* guber and mr. peters *produce*

all these vehicles **have** sharply improved nissan 's morale and image but have n't done much for its market share
strong sales so far this year *are* certain to turn the tide but even the N N market share that nissan *expects* in N will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade
likewise in the u.s. nissan *has* grabbed N N of the car market so far this year up from N N a year ago
but even that *brings* nissan only to the share it had in N and *leaves* the company behind its high of N N in N and N
nissan *hopes* that that will start to change this fall with its new version of the stanza compact sedan

nissan *has* increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in japanese car sales

mr. gorbachev badly *needs* a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he *faces* at home

senate majority leader george mitchell *d.* maine who *has* been the most prominent democratic critic of mr. bush 's handling of the soviet relationship praised the president for arranging the meeting
but he added the mere fact of a meeting *does* n't deal with the substance of policy
although no specific agreements *are* expected mr. shevardnadze said that *does* n't mean they will be without an agenda
if the two leaders *cover* the subjects that *have* been featured in lower level u.s.-soviet meetings their talks would include human rights soviet reforms regional disputes relations with allies economic cooperation arms control and joint efforts to fight narcotics terrorism and pollution
mr. gorbachev *has* for months been publicly urging the u.s. to drop its restrictions on soviet trade
economists in moscow *are* now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits
*do* n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation or arms control or the environment he said
instead th*is* official said this is vintage george bush
aside from the soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms one other *is*sue the soviets *are* likely to want to raise is naval force reductions
though president bush 's political critics at home *have* been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with mr. gorbachev it actually was the arguments of leaders within the soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the december meeting
but most cases of non-violent civil disobedience *are* not nearly so benign
it **is** true that both *are* non-violent but there is a fundamental difference between them
there *are* better ways to promote a cause

the protesters *lie* down in the street blocking traffic and will not move until the authorities *carry* them away
he *dies*

all *eastern* 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands *have* failed
an eastern spokesman said he *does* n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling will have any overall material effect on the company 's strategic plan
bankruptcy experts said the law *is* n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case
the obligation *is* totally unwarranted the statement said
th*is* is a blow not only to eastern but to the creditors committee he said
eastern 's creditors committee along with the company *has* consistently opposed the pilots ' claim which if paid would have to come out of money both *hope* to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims
eastern and its creditors *are* in the final delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts
it *is* n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan
the d*is*pute between eastern and its pilots is over a pay parity clause in the pilots ' contract
the two sides *do* n't even agree about how much money *is* at issue
another arbitrator *is* hearing another pay parity case between eastern and its pilots resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union
ironically many of the pilots involved *have* left eastern or *are* still striking the carrier which filed for bankruptcy protection march N

i *'ve* done over N ad agency searches for clients so i *have* a pretty good notion of what clients *are* interested in when they *look* for an agency mr. achenbaum said
when the announcement came out i picked up the phone and said why *do* n't you come to us mr. spielvogel said
the two men *are* longtime friends and tennis partners having met about N years ago
the fact of the matter *is* i *am* a marketer
that *'s* another reason for the backer spielvogel job
he will concentrate on among others *j.p.* morgan and hyundai

and if the europeans *come* in they *benefit* too
an asian bloc *is* n't intended he said
that *'s* not possible
it *'s* the total relationship that *is* important
the total relationship as mr. lee *sees* it *is* the flow of dollars to the u.s. to fund the deficits the investments the japanese *are* making in the u.s. in order to satisfy american demand that american products consumed in america should be made as much as possible in america by americans with japanese technology and capital
we *are* willing to share the political burden of being host to america an imperial power

i *do* n't think that *is* the case
it *is* hoped that other japanese would then follow the leader

takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in d**is**array georgia-pacific 's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed namely industrial companies can continue bidding for one another but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing

in addition its railroad lost a $ N million antitrust suit which *is* on appeal and which analysts *say* could be settled for one-third that amount
but santa fe currently trading at N N *is* n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets because the tax against it would be onerous
its plan instead *is* to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets
but it *is* n't clear why that should be so
and real estate usually *has* n't traded well under public ownership
salomon brothers *says* we *believe* the real estate properties would trade at a d*is*count after the realty unit is spun off
some analysts *remain* bullish
he *adds* *i*f for any reason i *do* n't have the values then i wo n't recommend it
but it *appears* to be the sort of hold one *makes* while heading for the door
in other words the real estate *has* a higher value than the pending deal *suggests*

ltv steel co. *is* boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an average of N N following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products
the big questions *are* whether the increase effective jan. N N will stick and whether other major steelmakers will follow suit
it *is* widely expected that they will
the increase **is** on the base price which is already being discounted by virtually all steel producers
but ltv 's move *marks* the first effort by a major steelmaker to counter the free fall in spot prices
major steel producers *are* selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $ N a ton compared with a peak price of $ N a ton in N
a spokesman for ltv steel which *is* a unit of dallas-based ltv corp. noted that steel prices adjusted for inflation increased only N N between N and the fourth quarter of N while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much
at the same time steelmakers *are* trying to invest more to modernize technology and make themselves more competitive
but analysts *say* the company *is* also trying to prevent further price drops
both companies *are* in the process of negotiating contracts with ltv and others
they *ltv* may believe th**is** can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices said peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc
mr. marcus *believes* spot steel prices will continue to fall through early N and then reverse themselves
he *is* n't convinced though that the price decline *reflects* falling demand because the world economy *remains* relatively strong
however the treasury said it will postpone the auction unless it *has* assurances of enactment of legislation to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auction date

republicans meanwhile *want* to try to protect the measure by combining it with two politically popular issues that democrats could find hard to block
the talks between senate majority leader george mitchell of maine and his gop counterpart sen. robert dole of kansas *are* expected to resume today
democrats *want* to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital-gains tax cut an individual bill
sen. mitchell *is* confident he *has* sufficient votes to block such a measure with procedural actions
while that could make it vulnerable to a veto by mr. bush *democrats* *argue* that a presidential rejection would give their party a valuable issue in next year 's congressional elections
senate democrats *are* to meet today to consider the gop proposal

but in an interview in which he called the stock market 's volatility a national problem big board chairman john j. phelan jr. said we *are* going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term to help the situation
the exchange *has* a board meeting scheduled for tomorrow and it *is* expected that some public announcement could be made after that
mr. phelan *has* n't been making public remarks in recent days and many people *have* urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue
exchange officials emphasized that the big board *is* considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading
people familiar with the exchange said another idea likely to be approved *is* expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who was doing it
meanwhile another big wall street brokerage firm joined others that *have* been pulling back from program trading
in stock-index arbitrage traders *buy* and *sell* large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets
first boston *is* one of the few major wall street firms that *have* n't pulled back from program trading in recent days
but he *has* been getting heat from all sides over program trading
mr. phelan 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading **have** drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists who *make* markets in individual stocks and from many companies that have shares listed on the big board
mr. phelan said that h**is** predicting continued volatility is just how the world is
if bringing the message *is* a crime i *'m* guilty of it
but he said th*is* *does* n't mean he is satisfied with the market 's big swings
each one *has* a different agenda
for example in a special meeting monday with mr. phelan senior officials of some of the big board 's N stock special*is*t firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests
we *are* looking for representation we *have* n't had a specialist said
after another session mr. phelan held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as morgan stanley & co. goldman sachs & co. painewebber group inc. and first boston all of which *have* engaged in program trading an executive of a top brokerage firm said clearly the firms *want* the exchange to take leadership
ultimately the specialists *view* this as yet another step toward electronic trading that could eventually destroy their franchise
his phelan 's own interests *are* in building an electronic marketplace said a market maker
despite what some investors *are* suggesting the big board *is* n't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures exchange officials said
i *think* if you can speed things up you can slow them down mr. phelan said
while volatility wo n't go away he said volatility *is* greater than program trading
what *i* *'m* trying to say to people *is* it **'s** proper to worry about program trading but it 's only a piece of the business
for example mr. phelan said that big institutions *have* so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market regardless of index arbitrage
but we *'re* not going back to N
japan 's markets *are* more stable he said
if that *continues* a significant number of u.s. companies will go over there to raise money
we *have* a major problem and that problem *is* volatility

the company *has* $ N billion in debt filed with the securities and exchange commission
a spokesman for underwriters *salomon* brothers inc. said beatrice cut its high-yield offering to $ N million from a planned $ N million after it became clear the company would have to give investors higher yields
since the recent deterioration of the junk-bond market at least two other junk issuers **have** said they *plan* to scale back planned high-yield offerings and several issues have been postponed

after all gold prices usually *soar* when inflation *is* high
it *'s* as if investors the past few days *are* betting that something *is* going to go wrong even if they *do* n't know what
if the stock market and the economy *catch* their breath and *show* that they *'re* on firmer footing these stocks might well fall back
still a lot of investors clearly *have* revived their interest in gold and utility shares
beyond that money managers and analysts *see* other problems
britain 's unsettled political scene also *worries* some investors
with this sort of sentiment common it *'s* natural for investors to seek out defensive investments
utilities *are* a classic example even in recessions people *continue* to use electric power water and gas at a fairly steady rate
such defensive issues as food tobacco and drug stocks *have* been in favor for some time
but many of these stocks *have* now become expensive
gold stocks *are* n't cheap on this basis either with many selling for N times earnings or more
if gold stocks and utilities *continue* to lead it may signal that the market *is* in for rough times
anyone telling you to buy stocks in th*is* market is technically irresponsible
you *do* n't want to own anything long except gold stocks
i *think* we could very well have an economic slowdown beginning very soon if not already he *says*
in such a climate utility stocks *look* good to him
you *go* into them because they *move* counter to the general market
he *adds* that gold stocks had been down so long they were ready for a bounce

while recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened i *intend* to urge that uv-b be monitored whenever i can
although like all scientific theories it had its initial opponents few experts *question* the connection now
solving the global environmental problems we all *face* will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry policy makers and the scientific community world-wide

despite yesterday 's modest bond market gains economists *say* investors *are* anxious about the treasury 's huge quarterly refunding of government debt the timing of which *depends* on congressional efforts to raise the debt ceiling
although the treasury will announce details of the november refunding tomorrow it could be delayed if congress and president bush *fail* to increase the treasury 's borrowing capacity
the debt ceiling *is* scheduled to fall to $ N trillion from $ N trillion at midnight tonight
those rates *are* up from N N and N N respectively at last week 's auction
due to the treasury 's need to raise funds quickly before the current authority to issue debt *expires* at midnight tonight yesterday 's auction was structured differently from previous sales
however analysts *expect* the fed to buy treasury bills that were auctioned yesterday in the secondary market
here *are* details of yesterday 's three-month and six-month bill auction
rates *are* determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
thus higher bidding *narrows* the investor 's return while lower bidding *widens* it

portfolio managers said expectations *are* for the issue to be priced at a discount with a coupon of N N N and a yield of about N N
the chicago-based food and consumer goods concern was acquired in april N in a $ N billion leveraged buy-out engineered by kohlberg kravis *roberts* & co
the senior subordinated debentures maturing in N *are* targeted to be offered at a yield of between N N N to N N N

the warrants *expire* on oct. N N and may be called by the company at a price of $ N
the offer *is* scheduled to expire on nov. N unless extended
that arrangement apparently *has* worked well and thomas a. bologna president and chief executive officer of gen-probe founded in N said the sale of the company *means* we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing
because the u.s. leads in most areas of biotechnology largely because of research investment by the u.s. government the sale *is* sure to increase concerns that japanese companies will buy american know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition
he added that until now the japanese *have* only acquired equity positions in u.s. biotechnology companies
during the past five years japanese concerns *have* invested in several of the u.s. 's N independent biotechnology companies
mr. bologna said the sale would allow gen-probe to speed up the development of new technology and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company *wants* to offer
we **think** gen-probe *has* technology important to people 's health he said adding we think it *is* important for us to have such technology
among other things *mr.* bologna said that the sale will facilitate gen-probe 's marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids
the tender offer for gen-probe 's shares *is* expected to begin next monday the company said
it *'s* a world leader in semiconductors but behind the u.s. in making the computers that *use* those chips
it *'s* a world leader in auto manufacturing but its aviation industry **is** struggling and its space program is years behind the u.s. the europeans and the soviets
the soviets also *hope* to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science which *has* helped them win twice as many nobel science prizes as the japanese
soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad *do* n't appear to worry the u.s. japan 's principal ally
we *have* never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the soviet union *says* a state department official
under mikhail gorbachev 's perestroika the soviets *have* sought economic ties all over the world including new export markets
japan *is* a major target for the soviets
a main motive *is* hard cash

a group of michigan investors **has** offered to buy knight-ridder inc. 's ailing detroit free press for $ N million but has left unclear how the offer will be financed
indeed some individuals identified with the group said they *have* n't committed any money to the bid and were n't aware of it until they *heard* about it in local news accounts over the weekend
the new company *is* capitalized at about $ N million
it also *hopes* to enter the u.s. market
the partnership said it *is* proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes *restrict* it from making distributions on its units outstanding
however unpaid distributions on the acquisition preferred *are* cumulative and would total $ N million a year hurting nrm 's financial flexibility and its ability to raise capital nrm said
in following several other oil and gas partnerships that **have** made the conversion to a corporation in the last year nrm also noted that tax advantages for partnerships have diminished under new tax laws and said it would save $ N million a year in administrative costs from the change

it *'s* somehow ok for secretary baker himself however to say all the same things

so far as we can see there *is* no disagreement among *mr.* baker mr. quayle the mr. *gates* we *'ve* read or for that matter president bush
they all *understand* point one nothing the u.s. can do will make much difference in whether mr. gorbachev *succeeds* with perestroika
but everyone *agrees* that mr. gorbachev 's problems *result* from the failure of his own system
on the other hand so long as mr. gorbachev *is* easing his grip on his empire everyone we *'ve* heard *agrees* that the u.s. can benefit by engaging him
mr. baker may want to avoid critic*is*m from senate majority leader george mitchell but as secretary of state his audience is the entire free world not just congress
it *is* in the western interest to see mr. gorbachev succeed
the odds *are* against him as he himself would no doubt tell you
the ultimate outcome *depends* on what he **do*es* not on what we do
his election *increases* ryder 's board to N members

republicans *acknowledge* that few people would be executed under the thurmond bill but they *contend* that *is* n't the point
thomas *boyd* a senior justice department official *says* the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last november may result in a jump in capital sentences though that *has* n't happened so far
that burden *is* very difficult if not impossible to meet *says* mr. boyd
and that in turn would only strengthen the argument of those who *oppose* execution under any circumstances

acadia partners limited partnership a fort worth texas partnership that *includes* the robert m. bass group made the proposal
mr. bass *is* based in fort worth
its problem they *say* **is** that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ N million debt load is keeping revco in the red
the partnership also *includes* american express co. equitable life assurance society of the u.s. and shearson *lehman* hutton inc
the offer *consists* of $ N million in cash and the rest in notes
he said he *has* not met with representatives from acadia
any reorganization proposal mr. *sells* said *is* difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company *bondholders* banks and other creditors
revco *has* $ N billion in claims outstanding

the forest-products concern currently *has* about N million shares outstanding
these fears were clearly apparent when last week secretary of state james baker blocked a speech by robert gates *deputy* national security adviser and soviet expert on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of mr. gorbachev 's economic reforms succeeding
and *has* he truly persuaded the communist party to accept economic change of a kind that will sooner or later lead to its demise
an alternative and more convincing explanation confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the gorbachev program *is* that the new soviet economic and social structures *are* intended to conform to a model other than that of the market
for example while the laws on individual labor activity *allow* a citizen to earn a living independent of the state strict provisions *are* attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market
perm*is*sion is far from automatic the soviets *have* the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions and they *appear* to be exercising these powers
but that changed following a resolution from the supreme soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some *are*as of the economy and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state
earlier this month the supreme soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives the first *enables* the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold the second bans cooperatives from buying industrial and food goods from the state or other cooperatives
mr. gorbachev *has* ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods
he told the congress of people 's deputies on may N we *do* not share this approach since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country
having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons and the market for fear of the social political consequences *mr.* gorbachev *seeks* a third way that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter
however mr. gorbachev must ensure that within this alliance the business sector *remains* subordinate to the party
the work force *provides* the third arm of the alliance
by providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages *tend* to be higher and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods *mr.* gorbachev *hopes* to revive the popularity of the party

moody 's investors *service* *inc.* said it lowered ratings on long-term debt of cs first boston inc. the holding company of wall street giant first boston corp. because of first boston 's aggressive merchant banking risk in highly leveraged takeovers
about $ N million of long-term debt *is* affected according to moody 's
a spokesman for cs first boston said we *remain* committed to a full range of businesses including merchant banking
we *think* that the ratings rev*is*ion is unfortunate but not unexpected
moody 's said its rating changes actions *reflect* cs first boston 's aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures
these two exposures alone *represent* a very substantial portion of cs first boston 's equity moody 's said
total merchant banking exposures *are* in excess of the firm 's equity
quotron systems *inc.* *plans* to cut about N or N N of its N employees over the next several months
the move by the financial information and services subsidiary of citicorp *is* a response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry which *has* been contracting since october N 's stock market crash the executive added
quotron which citicorp purchased in N *provides* price quotations for securities particularly stocks
the job cuts to be made in a number of *are*as at various job levels are a streamlining of operations a spokeswoman said
the spokeswoman said the move *is* n't directly a response to quotron 's loss of its two biggest customers *merrill* lynch & co. and american express co. 's shearson *lehman* hutton inc. to automated data processing inc. earlier this year
but citicorp *does* view quotron as being crucial to the financial-services business in the 1990s the analyst added

now the personal-computer revolution *is* finally reaching japan
and with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency more and more japanese companies *are* concluding that they *have* no choice
productivity in japanese offices *is* relatively low
but it also *offers* opportunities americans *are* well poised to supply the weapons
but for now at least americans *are* far better at making pcs and the software that *runs* them
after years of talking about selling in japan more and more u.s. companies *are* seriously pouring in
apple computer inc. *has* doubled its staff here over the past year
but the japanese *have* to go a long way to catch up
typical *is* one office of the ministry of international trade and industry 's machinery and information industries *bureau* the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry
japanese office workers *use* pcs at half the rate of their european counterparts and one-third that of the americans
moreover japanese offices *tend* to use computers less efficiently than american offices *do*
in the u.s. pcs commonly *perform* many tasks and plug into a broad network
the market planning and sales promotion office of nomura securities co. for example *has* more than N computers for its N workers a respectable ratio
others *analyze* the data
in japan those functions *account* for only about a third of the software market
machines dedicated solely to word processing which *have* all but disappe*are*d in the u.s. are still more common in japan than pcs
in japan about N N *are* linked
but healthy skeptic*is*m is only a small reason for japan 's pc lag
some analysts *estimate* the average pc *costs* about N N more in japan than the u.s.
but the complex language *is* n't the only reason
with little competition the computer industry here *is* inefficient
the u.s. market too *is* dominated by a giant international business machines corp
that *is* the state of japan 's computer industry
meanwhile the big players *have* n't tried to copy the nec standard
corporate pride as well as the close ties common among japanese manufacturers *help* explain why
the result according to many analysts *is* higher prices and less innovation
while tens of thousands of softw**are** packages using the ibm standard are available in the u.s. they *say* only about N are written for nec
there *are* no price *wars* no competition
she *adds* that some technological advances *trail* those in the u.s. because the japanese still *import* basic operating systems from american companies
but the market *is* changing
the government *is* funding several projects to push pc use
in the private sector practically every major company *is* setting explicit goals to increase employees ' exposure to computers
meanwhile more computer makers now *are* competing for the new business
it *has* won about N N of the retail pc market
many of the companies *are* even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard
but it could also help american companies which also *are* starting to try to open the market
as with many other goods the american share of japan 's pc market *is* far below that in the rest of the world
u.s. makers *have* under N N share compared with half the market in europe and N N at home
though no formal trade barriers *ex*is*t* the japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter

the decision by merrill the nation 's largest securities firm *represents* the biggest retreat yet from program trading
most wall street firms in pulling back *have* merely stopped such trading for their own accounts
merrill *has* been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers
in stock-index arbitrage traders *buy* and *sell* large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options
the idea *is* to lock in profits from short-term swings in volatile markets
index arbitrage mr. carpenter said last week *does* n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole and kidder 's customers were sophisticated enough to know that
but yesterday *mr.* carpenter said big institutional investors which he would n't identify told us they would n't do business with firms that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts
kidder so far th*is* year *has* executed a monthly average of N million shares in index-arbitrage trading and is second only to morgan stanley in overall program trading which *includes* index arbitrage
most of kidder 's program trading *is* for its own account according to the new york stock exchange
kidder *has* generally been sensitive to suggestions that ge *makes* decisions for its kidder unit
our decision had nothing to do with any pressure mr. *welch* received mr. carpenter said
a spokeswoman for ge in fairfield conn. said absolutely no one spoke to jack welch on th*is* subject and added anyone who *claims* they talked to jack welch is n't telling the truth
supporters of index arbitrage *have* n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy as some did during the post-crash outcry of N
but merrill lynch in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage suggested that the current debate *has* missed the mark
merrill said it *continues* to believe that the causes of excess market volatility *are* far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy
indeed there *are* legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that *involve* program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries
meanwhile bear stearns chairman and chief executive alan *c.* greenberg said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients

the treasury department proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers which officials *believe* *is* the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the u.s.
in recent testimony on capitol hill treasury officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements and the expected publication of the proposal in the federal reg*is*ter today is the first official step toward creating final regulations
the treasury *is* still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that *have* a hand in fighting money laundering

scient*is*ts *say* the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer *develops*
an emerging understanding of the genes *is* expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention
that *is* for the future
already scient*is*ts *are* developing tests based on the newly identified genes that for the first time can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer
like all genes tumor-suppressor genes *are* inherited in two copies one from each parent
all th*is* may not be obvious to the public which is concerned about advances in treatment but i *am* convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon
they *have* about seven candidates
it was the confirming evidence we all needed that gene losses were critical to the development of a common tumor *says* ray white at howard hughes medical institute in salt *lake* city
there also *are* reports from several labs as yet unpublished of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney brain and skin cancers
at the same time the johns *hopkins* team and others *are* rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes
it may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions though no one *has* come close to doing that so far

warner communications inc. and sony corp. resumed settlement talks on their legal battle over hollywood producers *peter* guber and jon peters but continued to level strong accusations at each other in legal documents
although settlement talks had been dropped attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before thursday when a judge *is* expected to rule on warner 's request for an injunction that would block the two producers from taking over the management of columbia
but mr. smith said sony *intends* to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist and that even the existing written contract *does* n't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio
warner which *is* in the process of being acquired by new york-based time warner inc. also said it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $ N million
dataproducts inc. said it filed a lawsuit in delaware chancery court to block a tender offer by dpc acquisition partners alleging that the hostile offer *violates* a standstill agreement between the two concerns
earlier this year *dataproducts* had rejected a $ N a share offer from dpc saying it was n't adequately financed
doug hammond the federal mediator in seattle where boeing *is* based said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal *emerges* or the talks *break* off again
the investment community however strongly *believes* that the strike will be settled before there *is* any lasting effect on either boeing or its work force
although the company could see fourth-quarter revenue shrink by nearly $ N billion if it *is* n't able to deliver any more planes this year those dollars actually would just be deferred until N
it *'s* not a pretty picture said david smith an analyst with raymond james & associates
but the strike *has* n't gone on long enough for boeing to lose business in any real sense
that *'s* the primary reason the company 's share price *has* held up so well when in mr. smith 's words most companies would have unraveled by now
th*is* contract covering about N hourly production and maintenance workers is being extended on a day-to-day basis
a boeing spokesman responded all along the company *has* said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution

foothills ' main rival to build a mackenzie delta pipeline *is* likely to be transcanada pipelines
neither *is* going to back down easily
but foothills said it *plans* to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line the alaska natural gas transportation system further north toward alaska
it *'s* also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects
the federal reserve board said it *is* delaying approval of first union corp. 's proposed $ N million acquisition of florida national banks of florida inc. pending the outcome of an examination into first union 's lending practices in low-income neighborhoods

the bank added that it *believes* the review will demonstrate that first union *is* in compliance with the requirements of the community reinvestment act
the company *has* already missed its initial oct. N target date for completing the merger
it said yesterday it still *expects* to close the acquisition later this year or early in N

deutsche bank dresdner bank and commerzbank all also *have* expressed eagerness to expand in france before N
deutsche bank *has* actively sought a french acquisition for at least two years
lately analysts *say* deutsche bank *has* shocked some in the french financial community by indicating it *wants* a strong bank with a large number of branches
we *are* still looking said a deutsche bank spokesman
the banks we *think* would fit into our concept *are* either government-owned or not for sale though deutsche bank would be able to pay a good price
while allianz officials were n't willing to comment in any detail on their plans they said allianz currently *holds* between N N and N N of navigation mixte an apparent increase from the N N stake that navigation mixte officials had earlier announced
allianz also *holds* a N N stake in navigation mixte 's insurance subsidiary one of france 's largest insurance groups which it bought for about N billion francs just before paribas launched its bid
navigation mixte *holds* the remaining N N
allianz said in its statement that it was acting to protect that interest which *ties* it to navigation mixte as a partner
allianz 's statement stressed the company 's previously announced position that paribas 's offer price *is* too low
allianz also suggested without saying so directly that it *regrets* that paribas *is* n't bidding for all of navigation mixte 's shares
the problem here analysts *say* *is* that if paribas *wins* its N N remaining navigation mixte shares will fall in value
the *allianz* statement led to speculation that allianz eventually could sell to paribas
it said simply that it will boost its navigation mixte stake as it *sees* fit over the coming days to protect itself as long as it *has* french regulatory officials ' approval
paribas currently *intends* to offer N francs a share for navigation mixte shares that *receive* full dividends this year
it *is* to offer N francs for shares created on july N which *receive* partial dividends
paribas already *holds* about N N of navigation mixte and the acquisition of the additional N N would cost it about N billion francs under its current bid
the bid *values* navigation mixte at around N billion francs depending on how many holders of navigation mixte warrants *exchange* them for shares before the bid *expires*

sidhpur and adjacent d*is*tricts *are* the only places in the world where psyllium is grown in large quantities
th*is* is partly due to the particular demands of the crop
small crops *are* grown in pakistan france spain italy belgium and brazil but their quality ca n't compare to that of indian psyllium

surveys repeatedly *show* that small-business owners *rank* the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns
i *have* an old-fashioned name for people in that position sick people who *need* health insurance rep. waxman *says*
the concern *grows* out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market
small-business people *end* up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness
but it *says* that rapid rate increases *are* directly tied to the soaring cost of health care
some business analysts *blame* the problem on tough competition in the insurance market
they *say* insurance companies *use* policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors *do*
but the general practice *makes* it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums

they will do it every chance they *get* said one program-trading executive
consequently abrupt swings in the stock market *are* not likely to disappear anytime soon they *say*
executives who *manage* these funds *see* the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the N crash
a bankers *trust* spokesman said that the company 's investment arm *uses* stock-index arbitrage to enhance investors ' returns
stock-index funds **have** grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole
some stock-index funds *are* huge
wells *fargo* investment advisers for example managed $ N billion in stock investments tracking the s&p N at the end of june according to standard & poor 's corp
stock-index funds frequently *use* the futures markets as a hedging tool but that *is* a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage in which traders *buy* and *sell* big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences

now as a new downturn in the chemical industry *looms* akzo *says* it *is* in far better shape to cope
investment analysts generally *agree*
aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants akzo *has* spent N billion guilders $ N billion on acquisitions since N to give it better balance
during the same period the company *has* sold about N billion guilders of assets
still akzo *has* n't yet found a way to achieve another goal a large presence in the u.s. market for prescription drugs
mr. bergsma said prices for u.s. pharmaceutical companies *remain* too high making it unlikely that akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area
but he said akzo *is* considering alliances with american drug companies although he would n't elaborate
analysts *expect* the company to show profit of about N million guilders up N N from N million guilders a year earlier
a bigger test will come next year if as many analysts *expect* bulk chemical prices *slump* in europe
he *figures* akzo *is* likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year
the bank projects *akzo* will show per-share earnings of N guilders in N up from an estimated N guilders for this year and the N guilders reported for N
the company *is* exposed to bulk chemicals however
a decline may come in the first half of N he said but the market *does* n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn
to reduce the danger of such pricing cycles *akzo* *has* invested heavily in specialty chemicals which *have* highly specific industrial uses and *tend* to produce much higher profit margins than *do* bulk chemicals

we *'re* sorry to see nigel lawson 's departure from the british government
the fleet street reaction was captured in the guardian headline departure *reveals* thatcher poison
we should also add mr. lawson 's own explanation as we *understand* it
inflation *is* easier to spark and harder to control
perhaps the f*is*cal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates though of course in the event mr. lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound not restrain a strong one
mr. reynolds also *notes* that since british banks *have* no reserve requirements high interest rates *are* less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession
we would add that in political terms *mrs.* thatcher 's problem was failing to decide between the chancellor and her adviser
in the end neither policy was followed and instead of learning anything we *are* left with a mystery
all the more so when strong voices *are* heard opposing the policy
what mr. major and mrs. thatcher will do now *remains* to be seen

this *includes* $ N billion of long-term debt $ N million in short-term debt and $ N million of the current portion of long-term debt
in a letter to investors chairman *edward* s. finkelstein wrote that he *expects* the company to benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors
while our competitors *are* concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers *need* and *want*
those chains *include* bloomingdale 's which campeau recently said it will sell
other retail properties for sale *include* saks fifth avenue and marshall field retailers now owned by b.a.t plc the british tobacco conglomerate
the volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive but looking at the whole fiscal year we *do* n't see the effect as material wrote mr. finkelstein
the sale at a higher price than some analysts had expected helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and *boosts* *nestle* 's N N share of the u.s. candy market to about N N
the nestle acquisition *includes* a candy plant in franklin park ill. which *employs* about N workers
the sale which had been expected *is* part of kkr 's program to pay down $ N billion of a $ N billion bridge loan by february
roughly $ N billion of that debt *has* already been repaid from previous asset sales and rjr *expects* to use another $ N billion from the pending two-part sale of most of its del monte unit
that sale however could still fall through if financing problems *develop*
thus it *remains* crucial for rjr to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands
since kkr bought rjr in february for $ N billion of debt it *has* agreed to sell nearly $ N billion of rjr assets
for them it *makes* all kinds of sense
the new candy bars *make* an important contribution to our nestle foods commitment to this very important strategic unit said c. alan macdonald president of nestle foods in purchase n.y

for the first time since the mid-1970s westinghouse this year *has* seen a significant increase in orders for power plants
most *are* from independent producers instead of regulated utilities and westinghouse *believes* it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years
analysts *agree* predicting that the revived market could significantly boost westinghouse 's bottom line in coming years
westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also *is* changing
at the same time westinghouse *hopes* its venture with mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition particularly in the u.s. from such european competitors as asea brown boveri ag *siemens* ag and british general electric co
it *is* expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which unlike utilities *are* n't regulated and therefore *do* n't need government approval to construct new plants
even if that scenario *occurs* westinghouse figures it *is* prepared
once we *see* an order we *expect* it 'll be on line by N

the rationale for responding to your customers ' needs faster than the competition can *is* clear your company will benefit in terms of market share customer satisfaction and profitability
however for many managing speed *does* not come naturally
speed *is* a component of quality one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers
companies that actually market speed as part of their service *train* their managers to lead and participate in teams that *increase* speed and improve quality in everyday operations
managers *learn* to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed and shift some responsibility for analyzing improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees
no customer **is** present at the morning package sort but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction
the sooner our vans *hit* the road each morning the easier it *is* for us to fulfill that obligation
the vans *leave* at least N minutes earlier on average than they used to
and service levels *have* increased to the point where they *'re* consistently above N N
first we **have** better quality assurance than ever because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work
managers in all three companies *recognize* speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction
they effectively *lead* team efforts to reduce cycle time
and they *prepare* all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work

i *like* to succeed *says* mr. rey during a recent morning of working at home which he also *likes*
bally was not an unfriendly takeover he *insists*

nevertheless mr. rey *has* been very c*are*ful since then to make sure his moves are welcome

for financial analysts reading omni 's accounts *is* a tough challenge
financial analysts *note* that mr. rey *is* attracted to companies that *are* undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests

the real estate can be used he *points* out as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development

un*is*ys corp. 's announcement friday of a $ N million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year
un*is*ys is getting clobbered
the quarter was terrible and the future *looks* anything but encouraging
that *is* at the high end of the range of N to N employees that unisys said a month ago would be laid off
still unisys said its european business was weak during the quarter a worrisome sign given that the company *has* relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the u.s. over the past several quarters
the company also reported slower growth in another important business systems that *use* the unix operating system
that would be a huge problem if it were to continue because un*is*ys is betting its business on the assumption that customers *want* to move away from using operating systems that *run* on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems mainly *unix* that work on almost anyone 's machines
debt *has* risen to around $ N billion or about N N of total capitalization
that *means* unisys must pay about $ N million in interest every quarter on top of $ N million in dividends on preferred stock
he said the strength of the world-wide economy *is* suspect and *does* n't see much revenue growth in the cards
he said the move toward standard operating systems *means* customers *are* n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down
but we *do* n't minimize the challenges of the near term
and un*is*ys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter
the break-even point for next year **is** much lower but is it low enough he asked
mr. straszheim *expects* he will take some heat and he *'s* right
in february N for example merrill lynch 's weekly commentary announced that the economy *is* likely to fall into recession in early N
it said long-term interest rates then above N N could drop to N N by the end of N so bonds which *benefit* from falling rates would be a good buy
while such changes might sound minor they *are* n't merrill lynch manages or *oversees* some $ N billion in retail accounts that *include* everything from mutual funds to individual annuities
my own personal opinion *is* that don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet he *says*
he *adds* that *'s* the forecasting business
however risky the business it *'s* brisk these days
th*is* is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities
th*is* is the commercial version
no sophisticated professional *expects* economists to be right all the time
some smaller clients *do* n't seem to notice his switch
i *'m* one of them who *hope* they will with $ N billion in debt on the books
he *does* n't fully succeed although mr. straszheim *lists* an array of interest-rate scenarios
or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it *'s* about to be right
sometimes like now it *'s* gray
another *challenges* *merrill* lynch 's bond recommendation last year
he *adds* i *think* it was a fairly decent call
our business *is* constantly looking at all these things he *says*

under the terms *milton* roy will pay an initial $ N million for the operations and additional payments during the next four years based on the earnings performance of the businesses
the reason *is* simple
when a country *cuts* tax rates it *makes* itself more attractive to investors and *drives* up the value of its currency
the price of attracting capital whether one 's own or that of foreigners *is* a trade deficit
to avoid this deficit *mr.* lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise
little wonder that *mrs.* thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep mr. lawson in office
then when the currency *falls* interest rates *are* raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate
the implications for britain france and the rest of europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country *need* considering before we *judge* mr. lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate
personal spending which fueled the economy 's growth in the third quarter was clearly slowing by the end of the period raising questions about the economy 's strength as the year *ends*
many economists *expect* the weakness to continue
i *do* n't think there *'s* a lot in the wings in other sectors of the economy to keep growth above N N he said
all the figures *are* adjusted for seasonal variations
here *is* the commerce department 's latest report on personal income
the agreement *is* subject to government approval

we *think* we *'re* getting only N N of the integration dollars our customers *are* spending he said
we *'re* in environments that *are* going to spend a lot of money on that
utilities management *is* a major commercial niche
but while its stock *is* selling at about half control data 's estimated breakup value neither messrs. perlman nor price said he *spends* much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover

mr. peters would fly to new york with the intention of telling warner communications *inc.* chairman steven j. ross that guber-peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for warner
warner *tells* another
in the affidavits *mr.* peters *says* he was shocked when mr. ross refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them
mr. peters *claims* he reminded mr. ross that robert daly and terry *semel* the top executives of the warner brothers studio had repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept an offer such as sony 's
warner *denies* mr. ross ever said any such thing and in fact denies virtually everything mr. guber and mr. peters *say* in their affidavits
thursday a judge *is* scheduled to rule on warner 's motion seeking to block the guber-peters duo from going to columbia
so far however sony *has* n't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands
sony for its part could decide that the cost of a warner settlement or court fight *is* too high choosing instead to find someone else to run columbia although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to mr. guber and mr. peters
sony and the guber-peters team *are* hanging much of their case on warner 's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they *say* allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up
warner denies such an agreement was made and *disputes* the guber-peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter
mr. peters *says* in his affidavit that the movie 's staff was told last week that warner was taking over the picture and another producer would be giving all of the orders
if he *calls* you up just tell him everything *is* fine
the less they *know* the easier it *is* for us
dozens of guber-peters staffers *are* still working on the warner lot and consulting on various projects on a daily basis the attorney *says*
mr. guber *says* he brought to lunch a release document warner had agreed to in N when he and mr. peters made an aborted bid to buy part of mgm\/ua entertainment co. to run the mgm studio
he *says* he told mr. guber he could n't sign any documents and that the deal although apparently a good one for him and mr. peters would have a very negative impact on warner
he said he would contact mr. ross and warner brothers chairman *robert* daly and that in a conference call the three agreed they could n't let the producers out of their contract
mr. ross in his own affidavit *says* he and mr. daly instructed mr. semel to tell the producers warner would n't terminate their agreement
moreover mr. guber *claims* mr. semel told him that mr. ross probably would n't object if it were anybody other than sony
but sony *is* a problem
the guber-peters side *has* said warner *is* particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge japanese company controlling important segments of the u.s. entertainment business
some in hollywood *suggest* mr. guber and mr. peters took encouragement from warner studio executives such as mr. semel and mr. canton too literally
but the warner executives in their affidavits *deny* ever telling the producers they could get out of their written contract
but mr. guber *indicates* in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used
for example he *says* that since N he and mr. peters *have* developed over N movie projects and warner *has* passed or chosen not to produce at least N
as for the projects remaining at warner mr. guber *says* mr. semel informed me that warner 's producers *have* already started a feeding frenzy for our projects
the system *is* still under construction and will serve a market of N homes
the law *sets* a deficit target of $ N billion for fiscal N
the white house and the democratic leadership in congress *blame* each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year
meeting with reporters *friday* mr. darman again said he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the house which would increase spending in future years
the increase *reflects* spending on the s&l rescue as well as payroll and social security checks normally issued in october that were issued in september this year because oct. N fell on a sunday
the company suffered a loss of $ N million in N but its financial situation *has* been improving since then
humana inc. said it *expects* to receive about $ N million in federal income-tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute
the health-care company said it *expects* the refund to be included in the first quarter ending nov. N
the refund *is* about $ N million
the refund *stems* from a court ruling that found certain payments by humana subsidiaries to its insurance subsidiary during fiscal N through N were deductible as premiums for liability insurance
but analysts *say* sansui *is* a special case
it *expects* to post a loss of N billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently *exceed* its assets by about N billion yen
stat*is*tics on acquisitions by foreigners *vary* in detail because unlike sansui which is listed on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges most of the japanese companies acquired by foreigners *are* privately held
but by all accounts foreign companies **have** bought only a relative handful of japanese companies this year while japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies
nor *do* analysts expect the sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases
while competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of japanese factories *sansui* lacked the money to build new plants in southeast asia
but even a japanese company that *looks* like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern some management consultants *maintain*
in some industries like pharmaceuticals acquisitions *make* sense
the bolstered cellular agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin broadcasting corp. *carries* heightened risks and could fail to fend off mccaw cellular communications *inc.* the rival suitor for lin
the plan still *calls* for lin to combine its cellular telephone properties with bellsouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations
lin said it *expects* to borrow the money to pay the dividend but commitments from banks still *have* n't been obtained
in effect mccaw *has* forced lin 's hand by bidding $ N billion for the stake earlier this month
analyst *estimate* the value of the bellsouth proposal at about $ N to $ N a share
mccaw the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the u.s. already *owns* about N N of lin 's stock
th*is* game is n't over yet said joel d. gross a vice president at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities *corp*
but i *do* n't think we *'re* at that point yet
mccaw 's bid also *has* a similar clause
we *'re* very pleased with the new deal
we *think* th*is* is a superior deal to mccaw 's
we *'re* surprised
but kenneth leon a telecommunications analyst with bear stearns & co. *finds* the bellsouth proposal still flawed because the company *does* n't have to wait five years to begin buying more lin shares
there *'s* nothing preventing bellsouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile
analysts were predicting N bellsouth earnings in the range of $ N a sh*are* or $ N billion but now those estimates are being scaled back
market makers in nasdaq over-the-counter stocks *are* adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading
stock-index arbitrage the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies *affects* the otc market directly through the N stocks included in standard & poor 's 500-stock index
the s&p N *is* often used in arbitrage strategies
the portion of otc volume attributable to program trading **is** n't known as it is on the new york stock exchange where it amounted to more than N N in september
some of these problems *are* neither new nor unique to the otc market
we were n't as concerned until they became sell programs *says* mr. dapuzzo who now *thinks* it *adds* unnecessary volatility
shearson merrill lynch and goldman sachs *say* they *do* so only for customers however
kidder peabody *does* program trading for its own as well as clients ' accounts
of course there were sell programs in past years too but they *seem* to hurt market makers more painfully these days
market makers to cut costs slashed inventories of stocks they *keep* on hand to sell investors when other holders *are* n't selling
on days when prices *are* tumbling they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will
it *'s* harder to sell stocks when the sell programs *come* in because some market makers *do* n't want to take the orders
no one *has* big positions and no one *wants* to take big risks
sometimes traders *lose* sight of that he *says*
these big stocks greatly *influence* the nasdaq composite index
the problem market makers *say* **is** that while the industrial average and the s&p N usually *recover* as buy programs *kick* in the nasdaq composite frequently is left behind
this gap eventually *closes* but slowly
the average daily share turnover for october *is* almost N million shares
mccaw which dropped N N to N N *has* offered $ N a share for a majority of lin 's shares
lin now *plans* to dole out $ N a share in cash up from the earlier $ N amount
other dealers added that the blue-chip stocks in general were hit by profit-taking over concerns that london shares will continue posting declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that *mr.* lawson 's successor john major had only been in the job one day
frankfurt prices closed lower again *friday* the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the dax index lose N N
the dax dropped N points *friday* to N
if you *take* away the outside *influences* the market itself *looks* very cheap
what *'s* happening here *is* n't justified by the fundamentals
traders said the market *remains* extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the new york stock exchange last week
here *are* price trends on the world 's major stock markets as calculated by morgan stanley capital international perspective geneva

congress sent to bush an $ N billion military construction bill that *cuts* spending for new installations by N N
the talks in new york *are* the first since bush and soviet foreign minister shevardnadze unveiled proposals in september to scrap existing weapons
for now both companies *are* keeping quiet about their specific plans
likely changes *include* more emphasis on research soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing
both companies *are* conservative marketers that *rely* on extensive market research
the company *says* sales *have* soared
the presence of unilever and p&g *is* likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics
while the two *are* among the world 's biggest advertisers most makers of upscale cosmetics *spend* relatively little on national ads
instead they *focus* on events in department stores and *pour* their promotional budgets into gifts that *go* along with purchases
p&g in fact *is* noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that *offer* a technical edge over the competition
in the 1970s several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies including colgate-palmolive co. *eli* lilly & co. *pfizer* inc. and schering-plough acquired cosmetics companies
unilever already *has* experienced some disappointment
over the past week the president *has* agreed to keep the committee informed usually in advance of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing
despite objections by the cia mr. bush also *has* agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the cia who would be independent of the cia director
in return the senate panel *has* dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within N hours of the launching of any covert activity
the president also hinted he might veto th*is* year 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive
the white house got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative republicans who *do* n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities
several of the new york stock exchange 's own listed companies led by giant contel corp. *are* joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it
claiming program trading *has* turned the big board into a gambling casino contel chairman charles wohlstetter said that he and at least N other corporate executives *are* forming an unprecedented alliance
what *is* the mission of the financial community
contel *is* a $ N billion telephone and electronics company
pressure *has* been building on the big board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility which many investors *say* *is* caused by program trading
he said he *'s* upset that mr. phelan trying to calm investors after the plunge said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings
their powerful members *manage* them
the focus of the outcry *has* been stock-index arbitrage which *accounts* for about half the program trading that *goes* on
the big board *has* refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading
it *is* partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock basket product that *allows* big investors to buy or sell all N stocks in the standard & poor 's index in a single trade
one intended customer of the new basket product *is* index arbitragers according to the exchange
now the assault *is* on said one top trader
contel 's mr. wohlstetter said the group of big board companies **is** n't ready to go public yet with its effort and that he *does* n't plan to be the leader once it is public
among the targets of the big board companies ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that *use* program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments
for contel 's part the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they *give* business to program-trading firms
kidder officials *stand* by their aggressive use of program trading
chief executive officer michael carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of kidder 's own brokers he *believes* index arbitrage *does* n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole
ge chairman john welch *has* been besieged with phone calls complaining about his unit 's program trading according to a person close to him

it *sounds* like the work of a decade but the deadline **is** late N when mrs. thatcher is expected to call another national election
analysts *expect* further jitters this week
economists *have* been anticipating a slump for months but they now *say* it will be deeper and longer than they had thought
recovery could be hampered if britain 's major trading partners in europe which *are* enjoying robust economic activity *cool* off as expected in late N and N
though mrs. thatcher *does* n't need to call an election until june N she would prefer doing so in late N
there *'s* an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the european community
it *has* sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the european monetary system which *links* the major ec currencies
since then the government *has* left observers wondering if it ever meant to join
as conservatives *rally* around mrs. thatcher during the crisis many *harbor* hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change

a state trial judge in illinois gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a bank of new york co. unit irving trust co. over the interest rates on irving 's former one wall street *account* money-market deposit accounts

a bank of new york spokesman in manhattan owen brady said that *'s* the maximum outside figure
but under alan greenspan that *has* changed
indeed his caution *has* become legendary within the government
at a hearing last week democratic sen. chris dodd of connecticut told treasury secretary nicholas *brady* that chairman greenspan 's announcement over the oct. N weekend was a very important statement
and by the end of that week the key federal funds interest rate which *is* largely controlled by the fed had settled at N N barely changed from the level of just under N N that prevailed the previous week
bush admin*is*tration officials *appear* increasingly concerned that mr. greenspan is cautious to a fault
those concerns *are* n't expressed in public
still the split *is* there
the economy *is* showing signs of weakness particularly among manufacturers
exports which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years *seem* to have stalled
in addition the chairman *has* a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road
so far mr. greenspan 's cautious approach to policy *has* served both him and the nation well
i *think* you *have* to give greenspan a good rating
but such caution *is* no guarantee against mistakes
if that *happens* chairman greenspan could well become an open target
if the economy *turns* down such proposals could gain strong momentum

kidder peabody & co. *is* trying to struggle back
now the firm *says* it *'s* at a turning point
i *'ve* done what i came to do at kidder he *says*
it *'s* quite a fall from the early 1980s when kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse
but they *have* to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one
in fact *kidder* *is* a minor player in just about every business it *does* except computer-driven program trading in that controversial business only morgan stanley & co. rivals kidder
but even that niche *is* under attack as several wall street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors
there *have* been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm 's operations
more than N new managing directors and senior vice presidents *have* been hired since january
mr. *carpenter* *says* that when he *assumes* full control kidder will finally tap the resources of ge
the leveraged buy-out group of ge capital now *reports* to mr. carpenter
it *'s* been a steadily improving relationship *says* mr. carpenter
still without many actual deals to show off kidder *is* left to stress that it finally *has* a team in place and that everyone *works* harder
a month ago the firm started serving dinner at about N each night about N to N of the N people in the investment banking operation *have* consistently been around that late
the kidder name *is* one of only six or seven that every ceo *recognizes* as a viable alternative when considering a merger deal he *says*
mr. carpenter *denies* the speculation
mr. carpenter *notes* that these types of investors also *are* sophisticated enough not to complain about kidder 's aggressive use of program trading
smiling broadly when he *talks* about *mr.* carpenter mr. cathcart *says* the new kidder chief *is* going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business

rather it *'s* a device that could send shock waves through the president 's entire relationship with democrats and republicans alike in congress fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government *does* its business
president bush badly *wants* a line-item veto and *has* long called for a law giving it to the president
now the white house *is* declaring that he might not rely on congress which *has* n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority to pass the line-item veto law he *seeks*
white house spokesmen last week said mr. bush *is* considering simply declaring that the constitution *gives* him the power exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he *has* the right
they *prefer* to put off the line-item veto until at least next year
still mr. bush and some other aides *are* strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto
mr. bush former president reagan and a host of conservative activists *have* been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process
conservatives *note* that N governors *have* the line-item veto to use on state budgets
there *'s* little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court and that it would quickly make its way to the supreme court to be ultimately resolved
it *puts* this president in the legislative business he *declares*
and it *is* n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they *tend* to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves
lawmakers they *say* would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later
republicans *have* as much interest as democrats in the way the system *works* he *notes*
rep. edwards *voices* the traditional conservative view that it *'s* a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person
conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now he *notes* may regret it later sometime you *'re* going to have a democratic president again who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives

another finding from the study prosecutors *set* significantly different priorities
the study *is* to provide reporters academic experts and others raw data on which to base further inquiries

a reading of less than N N **indicates** an economy that *is* generally contracting while a reading above N N indicates an economy that *'s* expanding
but the thing it *'s* supposed to measure manufacturing strength it missed altogether last month
david wyss chief financial economist at data resources *inc.* boston said that the purchasers ' index *does* miss occasionally adding when it *misses* one month it *tends* to miss the next month too
the consensus view on september leading indicators *calls* for a gain of N N the same as in august
usually october *is* n't a very interesting month for retail figures because school clothes *have* been bought and people *are* waiting for december to buy christmas presents he said
seasonal factors **are** also expected to have taken their toll on september new-home sales which are believed to have fallen sharply from august 's N units
construction spending *is* believed to have slipped about N N from august levels although economists noted the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage
factory owners *are* buying new machinery at a good rate this fall machine tool makers *say* but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks *raise* questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry

in addition once money **is** raised investors usually *have* no way of knowing how it is spent
but the last stock market boom in N *seems* small compared with the current rush to market
the $ N billion that some N companies *are* looking to raise in the year ending march N *compares* with only $ N billion raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year
th*is* year 's biggest issue $ N million of convertible debentures by engineering company larsen & toubro ltd. is the largest in indian history

the second factor spurring mega-*is*sues is political
mr. gandhi *has* called general elections for november and many businessmen *fear* that he and his congress i party will lose
some companies *are* raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than mr. gandhi 's and possibly more restrictive
so far the mega-issues *are* a hit with investors
larsen & toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month bankers and analysts *expect* it to be oversubscribed
while many investors **are** selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues prices on india 's N stock exchanges are holding up so far
i *do* n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market *says* mr. patel only a sagging tendency
disclosures *are* very poor in india
he *says* the big questions *do* you really need th*is* much money to put up these investments *have* you told investors what is happening in your sector what about your track record *are* n't asked of companies coming to market
an example *is* the biggest offering of them all *larsen* & *toubro* 's $ N million bond issue
although larsen & toubro had n't *raise*d money from the public in N years its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market
the media *has* raised questions about larsen & toubro 's issue pointing out that it *exceeds* the company 's annual sales and its market capitalization
once the money ***is*** raised it is n't always certain how it is used
larsen & toubro for example *says* it *'s* raising $ N million to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs

in the u.s. jaguar 's american depositary receipts were among the most active issues *friday* in national over-the-counter trading where they closed at $ N each up N cents

dentsu inc. the world 's largest advert*is*ing agency on the strength of its dominance in the japanese market is setting its sights on overseas expansion
now the giant marketing company which *holds* N N of japan 's N trillion yen $ N billion advert*is*ing industry is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the u.s. or europe
what **is** driving dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its japanese clients as they *grow* in the u.s. and europe
if we *do* n't do something we wo n't be able to catch up with demand *says* a dentsu spokesman
our president said acqu*is*ition is an effective method
last year dentsu 's foreign business accounted for less than N N of total billings but the company *is* aiming at N N in the near future
so far it *appears* cautious about taking the big step
for example the spokesman *says* dentsu *has* been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled british marketing group saatchi & saatchi plc
but he said dentsu *has* n't looked seriously at saatchi
it *is* setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad
but japanese agencies **are** cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different
although acquiring a foreign company would expand japanese advertising agencies ' business to foreign clients many clients would also be japanese companies expanding overseas *says* the dentsu spokesman
but the different business system would make it hard for dentsu to provide these japanese companies the same kind of services they *do* in japan
the announcement said the acqu**is**ition should be completed by december after a definitive agreement is completed and regulatory approval is received

insurers may see claims resulting from the san francisco earthquake totaling nearly $ N billion far less than the claims they *face* from hurricane hugo but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months
that *'s* because only about N N of california homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses
however insurance brokers and executives *say* that the combination of the bay area earthquake hugo and last week 's explosion at the phillips petroleum co. 's refinery in pasadena texas will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump
she *believes* the impact of losses from these catastrophes *is* n't likely to halt the growth of the industry 's surplus capital next year
property reinsurance rates *are* likely to climb first analysts and brokers *believe*
insurers typically *retain* a small percentage of the risks they *underwrite* and *pass* on the rest of the losses
however companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance *are* likely to see their rates *remain* flat or perhaps even *decline* slightly
but some large insurers such as state farm mutual automobile insurance co. *do* n't purchase reinsurance but *fund* their own program

several longtime observers of the commodities industry *think* the fortunes of the merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract *does* and how successful its new president *is* in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and commodity futures trading commission rules
the cftc *has* N days to respond to such applications
mr. thompson first came to the exchange in N and *has* been executive vice president since march N

the merc *'s* extremely successful contracts in crude oil gasoline and heating oil *have* made it the largest futures exchange in new york and third behind the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange
mr. conway *is* no longer at the exchange
we had a management breakdown in N in terms of compliance mr. thompson *says*
he *says* that even if the natural gas contract *boosts* volume at the exchange strongly the N business plan *calls* for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules *are* being followed
so far there *is* little to show for such efforts
mr. thompson *believes* the case for working together *is* stronger now than ever

how quickly things *change*
but while analysts *say* that municipal bonds still *offer* good value you would n't know it by the way institutional investors *are* rushing to dump their holdings
bond market analysts *say* the institutional selling was triggered by several factors
big banks such as chemical bank and chase manhattan which *have* been taking heavy charges to expand their third world loan-loss reserves *are* n't looking for tax-exempt income
we *do* n't need the shelter of tax-free bonds said a spokeswoman at chemical

insurance companies *are* rushing to sell before the end of the year when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out

there will still be deals *argues* mr. connolly
there may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things they *'ve* done in the past but deals wo n't disappear
he *forecasts* that the emphas*is* in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he *calls* strategic deals in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow but because it *'s* a good fit
and even without deals *mr.* connolly *figures* the market would remain healthy
he *notes* for instance that there *has* n't been a merger or acquisition among the N stocks in the dow jones industrial average since N yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high
those stocks ***are*** up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up he *says*
even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies *is* n't entirely bad in mr. connolly 's view
who can make the better decision the guy who *has* N seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world he *says*
he *'s* now estimating that after a period of consolidation the dow jones industrial average will once again forge new highs
at current levels of economic activity and earnings stocks *are* fairly valued she *says*
i *'m* not saying they *'ve* stopped altogether but future deals *are* going to be structured differently and *bids* probably wo n't be as high

total pentagon requests for installations in west germany japan *south* korea the united kingdom and the philippines for example *are* cut by almost two-thirds while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home

most of the land in that and other parts of the delta *are* now owned by second third or fourth generations of the same families
because the cycle of poverty along the lower mississippi *goes* back so many generations breaking this cycle will be next to impossible

delta problems **are** difficult not impossible to solve i *am* just not convinced that we are ready to solve them yet
many of the problems you presented *exist* in every part of this country
poverty *is* only two blocks from president bush 's residence

wanted an investment that *'s* as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but *offers* a return worth getting excited about
now the nationwide average yield on a six-month cd **is** just under N N and N N is about the best around
but investors looking for alternatives *are* n't finding it easy
yields on most fixed-income securities *are* lower than several months ago
and the stock market 's recent gyrations *are* a painful reminder of the dangers there
here *'s* a look at some of the alternatives
rates *approach* N N on five-year municipals
these securities *get* top credit ratings because the issuers *have* put aside u.s. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals *are* retired
the idea *is* to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates
bond mutual funds *offer* diversification and *are* easy to buy and sell
buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they *are* right
but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates *rise* instead
bond resale prices and thus fund share prices *move* in the opposite direction from rates
the short term bond fund with an average maturity of N N years would deliver a total return for one year of about N N if rates *drop* one percentage point and a one-year return of about N N if rates *rise* by the same amount
if interest rates *do* n't change bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields
an interest rate *is* guaranteed for between one and seven years after which holders *get* N days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that *are* common to annuities
some current rates *exceed* those on cds
annuities *are* rarely a good idea at age N because of the withdrawal restrictions
but at age N they may be a great deal *says* mr. wilson the columbia s.c. planner
that *'s* right money market mutual funds
the conventional w*is*dom is to go into money funds when rates *are* rising and shift out at times such as the present when rates *seem* headed down
with average maturities of a month or so money funds *offer* fixed share prices and floating returns that *track* market interest rates with a slight lag
a new fund its operating expenses *are* being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor
if rates unexpectedly *rise* the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund
the united kingdom reports came from dr. patrick *toseland* head of clinical chemistry at guy 's hospital in london
we *are* now monitoring for it much more closely he said
reports of dr. toseland 's findings in the british press *have* triggered widespread concern among diabetics there
a loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia **is** a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used the american association said
the company which *makes* data base systems and software said it *expects* to report a loss for the third quarter ended sept. N
defense intellectuals *have* complained for years that the pentagon can not determine priorities because it *has* no strategy
this city *does* n't work that way
with a five-year defense plan costing more than $ N trillion it *'s* about time we *put* together a defense strategy that *works* in washington
this wo n't happen until strategists *come* down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures
the pentagon 's strategists *produce* budgets that simply can not be executed because they *assume* a defense strategy *depends* only on goals and threats
strategy however *is* about possibilities not hopes and dreams
reform *starts* in the pentagon
there *is* no reason that it can not be done for defense planning
two steps *are* necessary to translate this idea into action
it *is* known in the pentagon as the negative wedge
the N plan also *assumes* inflation will decline to N N by N
note how the baseline program *assumes* a sharp increase in future appropriations
this scenario *has* been the rough position of the u.s. senate since N and it *reduces* the baseline by $ N billion between N and N
this *reduces* the baseline by $ N billion
it *reduces* the baseline by $ N billion
finally scenario N *reduces* the budget by N N per year for the next five years a total reduction of $ N billion
a strategic review *is* fundamentally different
while wall street 's tough times and lower u.s. interest rates *continue* to undermine the dollar weakness in the pound and the yen *is* expected to offset those factors

in tokyo monday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N *yen* down from friday 's tokyo close of N yen
as far as the pound *goes* some traders *say* a slide toward support at $ N may be a favorable development for the dollar this week
while the pound *has* attempted to stabilize currency analysts *say* it *is* in critical condition
he was succeeded by john major who *friday* expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high british interest rates that he said *are* working exactly as intended in reducing inflation
but the market *remains* uneasy about mr. major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound currency analysts *contend*
if there *are* any signs that mr. major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge that currency *is* expected to fall sharply
it *'s* fair to say there *are* more risks for the pound under major than there were under lawson *says* malcolm *roberts* a director of international bond market research at salomon brothers in london
there *'s* very little upside to sterling mr. roberts *says* but he *adds* that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed mr. major 's appointment apparently *has* run its course
but such an increase he *says* could be viewed by the market as too little too late
the yen 's softness she *says* apparently *stems* from japanese investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase u.s. bond issues and persistent worries about this year 's upheaval in the japanese government
the opposite *is* true it *'s* the product of many meetings with administration officials *senate* staffers advocates and business and transportation officials

hong kong financial institutions *have* been waiting for interest-rate futures for a long time
but securities regulators now *say* privately that it *is* n't likely to start until the first quarter of next year
analysts and financial officials in the british colony *consider* the new contract essential to the revival of the hong kong futures exchange which *has* never fully recovered from the october N crash
many *believe* that without a healthy futures *exchange* hong kong 's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer
if the contract *is* as successful as some *expect* it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in hong kong
a futures contract *is* an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date
in the case of stock-index and interest-rate futures the instruments **are** given an underlying cash value and are settled in cash
there was no problem at all *says* douglas ford chief executive officer of the futures exchange
even though the currency *is* pegged to the u.s. *do*llar with a fixed exchange rate of hk$ N to the american currency the u.s. and hong kong economies do n't always move in lock step making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go
despite the initial support expected trading in the contract *is* likely to start slowly
companies and financial institutions familiar with hong kong *remain* wary of trading in its futures market
he *says* the contract will be considered a success if it *starts* trading N to N lots a day
but many bankers *remain* nervous especially as the start-up of the contract *continues* to be delayed

when the going *gets* tough it *'s* tough to trade stocks in continental europe
the weaknesses of continental exchanges *are* driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on london 's stock exchange which *quotes* firm trading prices for about N blue-chip issues from N major countries
some dealers *say* other traders were n't picking up their phones
but london *'s* problems were nothing compared with the continent 's
it was a nightmare *says* susan noble an investment manager at robert fleming holdings ltd. 's international investment management unit in london
it *'s* very worrying that these markets ca n't cope
for one thing the size of the affected market *is* enormous the european stock markets *account* for some N N of global stock market capitalization with an estimated value of $ N trillion according to morgan stanley capital international
the continental markets alone *contribute* about N N of estimated world market capitalization of $ N trillion
though the widely traded sh***are***s that are quoted in london account for only a small portion of those totals they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally
against th*is* backdrop one thing that *does* n't seem likely to result from N is a single european stock market
rather there increasingly *is* a group of international brokerage and trading firms that *operate* in most european financial centers including european giants such as barclays bank plc and deutsche bank as well as merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. of the u.s. and japan 's nomura securities co
meantime brokers on the continent *are* worried too mostly by the potential loss of business
he *acknowledges* that spreads were too wide and volumes too light in the extreme conditions on manic monday
already the germans *appear* to be acting at a special meeting on the day of the decline directors of the frankfurt stock exchange voted to extend their trading hours although they *have* n't decided when or by how much
the dutch who had some trading problems because of insufficient computer capacity *say* new equipment to solve the problems ought to be installed within a month

the company said it *is* n't making a commitment to purchase a specific number of shares
european community employers *fear* that the ec comm*is*sion 's plans for a charter of fundamental social rights is a danger to industrial competitiveness
the british government also strongly *opposes* the charter in its current form
but the cosmetic changes *are* n't expected to win over britain
we still *have* serious differences with the text a british official said because it *provides* for a regulation of the labor market
indeed lower wages in greece they **are** a third of the ec average are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries
sam ramirez and his men *are* late
after years of wild swings oil prices over the last N months *have* settled at around $ N to $ N a barrel
not that oil suddenly *is* a sure thing again
drilling activity *is* still far below eight years ago there *'s* no hiring surge and some companies *continue* to shrink
with all this even the most wary oil men *agree* something *has* changed
it *does* n't appear to be getting worse
that in itself *has* got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic *says* glenn *cox* the president of phillips *petroleum* co
though modest the change *reaches* beyond the oil patch too
the catalyst for all this *has* been opec
in addition global petroleum demand *has* been climbing
it *is* projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day or up to N N annually for years to come
for opec that *'s* ideal
oil ministers now *hope* to solve the issue for good through an iranian proposal that *gives* a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and *reduces* the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway
the view of some others in big oil he *maintains* *is* very much similar to amoco 's outlook
just this week *mobil* corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations
santa fe *aims* to drill about N wells in this area in N and double that next year
we went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect *says* tim parker a santa fe exploration manager
now everybody *is* a lot more optimistic
if you *know* you *'ve* got stability in price you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years
still there *is* money to be made
most oil companies when they *set* exploration and production budgets for this year forecast revenue of $ N for each barrel of crude produced
it *says* N N of those surveyed *report* that N exploration spending will exceed N 's
funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices *stay* stable
wall street generally *likes* the industry again
they *are* grace energy corp. of dallas and marine drilling co. of houston
most oil companies *are* still reluctant to add to the office and professional staffs they slashed so deeply
but a few new spots *are* opening
already it *'s* hard to get people
for most field workers it *'s* about time
last year i was off a straight month then one time for two to three weeks and another two to three weeks he *says*
first year i came back there was n't any work he *says*
i *think* it *'s* on the way back now
the figures *confirm* that there certainly *is* n't any drilling boom
some equipment going to work *is* almost new
i sense that it *'s* going to continue to grow
that *'s* the word
the word *is* out

australia 's national companies and securities comm*is*sion said it will allow s.a. brewing to acquire an option on as much as N N of bell resources *ltd.* a unit of bond corp. that is in the process of acquiring bond corp. 's brewing businesses for N billion australian dollars us$ N billion
bond corp. a brewing property media and resources concern controlled by financier alan bond *is* selling many of its assets to reduce an a$ N billion debt
mr. dorfman *states* that an investor who invested $ N a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later purchasing the four new pro picks and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $ N excluding account dividends taxes and commissions
accepted theories of asset pricing *offer* a perfectly legitimate explanation
accepted theories state that investors *require* higher returns on riskier investments
i *believe* the r*is*k for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large
this *means* the returns can vary a great deal
what *matters* *is* that the stocks recommended by your pros *tend* to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio
for example your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month *are* on average N N riskier than holding the market portfolio according to value line 's beta estimates
now it *'s* getting downright dangerous
los angeles police *say* the thieves *seem* to be part of a crime network that *knows* how to convert blank tickets into real ones

they said they wanted to show me how serious they were he *says*

texans *get* reasonable car rental insurance
consumer advocates *have* long claimed that car rental companies *charge* too much for car rental insurance
now a new law in texas *seems* to be providing the proof
specifically the law *says* the rates must closely reflect what the company 's actual expenses *have* been to replace damaged cars
now they *'re* charging as little $ N a day
a spokesman for hertz corp. *acknowledges* the waiver *is* n't a source of protection for consumers but a source of revenue
but hertz points out that at least it *'s* now charging only $ N a day in texas while some competitors *are* charging $ N
flight attendants lag before jets even *land*
this *happens* because the faa *does* n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants by contrast it strictly *restricts* duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers usually to a maximum of N consecutive hours
experts *say* such long hours for attendants *pose* a safety risk
they *have* to work such long hours and then we *expect* them to be heroes if there *'s* an evacuation
in response to the study the faa *says* it *is* considering changing its policy or lack of it on flight attendants
golf *has* become the latest diversion for travelers stuck at some airports
the average cost for breakfast at a decent hotel restaurant in new york *is* $ N according to corporate travel magazine
why *do* you maintain the house-passed capital-gains plan **is** a temporary reduction when it is not
i *think* the reason *is* that you *are* confusing tax rates with tax payments
your sept. N page-one story on the house-passed capital-gains plan *is* a good example
you *lead* readers to believe that the house reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only
but in any event and th**is** is the important point tax payments on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law even though the tax rate is the same under both systems
i *hope* that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and in my view most beneficial feature indexation
but what **is** really significant is the indexation of capital gains after N
to argue that th**is** is not likely to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense
*does* the journal really believe that people *ignore* the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they *decide* whether to save or how to invest
grace a maker of specialty chemicals that already owned about N N of closely held sierra said it *owns* a N N stake in the new company
the business *is* expected to have sales of about $ N million in N grace said
poughkeepsie also *expects* to post a one-time charge of $ N million resulting in a net loss for the third quarter
the charge *represents* a write-down of the goodwill associated with poughkeepsie 's investment in the banks it *is* trying to sell and its north carolina branches as well
the thrift announced the plan *aug.* N
among other reasons high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks substantially altered the economics of the transaction for both parties *poughkeepsie* said
additionally the bank *is* increasing its loan-loss reserves for the third quarter by $ N million before taxes
both moves *are* effective today
unless of course it *happens* to be run by the rothschilds
yet the rothschilds *do* n't deny an emotional element to the decision
indeed the competition *is* n't greatly concerned
it would be surprising if they did n't come to frankfurt in time for N and they *bring* an interesting tradition
but the market really *is* n't going to be stood on its head said a banker at one of frankfurt 's big three banks
the return of the rothschilds *is* modest
he left his job as general manager of shearson lehman hutton holdings *inc.* 's frankfurt office because he *says* when the rothschilds called i could n't resist
the paris bank *does* n't publish that figure
yet the group 's limited resources *makes* it a niche player
as at the zurich bank the minimum investment for individuals will be high about a million german marks $ N three times what many other west german investment banks *require*
as program trading *comes* under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations a few people on wall street *say* it *is* time to consider extreme measures
the real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices they *say* might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures
a stock-index future *is* a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks such as the standard & poor 's 500-stock index
but increasingly people *are* questioning that view and the critics *include* some of the country *'s* most successful investors
warren buffett *has* been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in N
and those who *remain* he *says* will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies
essentially the critics of stock-index futures *fall* into two camps
while it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices traders now routinely check the futures markets in chicago before they *buy* or *sell* stocks
when chicago futures prices *jump* up or down the new york stock exchange *follows*
the fundamentals *do* n't change in an hour he *says*
i *think* they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing
the kind of instant liquidity that **is** implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day
it *is* n't investing
but stock-index futures *have* plenty of support
defenders *say* futures *make* markets more efficient and *provide* ways for investors to reduce risks
they *note* that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures
and defenders *say* few people *complain* about futures when stock prices *are* rising
futures he *says* merely cut down on trading costs
since stock-index arbitrage merely *narrows* the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets it ca n't add to volatility he *says*
despite the current outcry over stock market volatility few people *expect* stock futures to disappear
for one thing the chicago futures exchanges *have* political and financial clout including many friends in congress
and traders *say* that futures *have* become an accepted part of the financial landscape
if futures *are* n't permitted here we 'll take it to australia or tokyo
many investment managers *say* futures *are* useful as a way to hedge portfolios
if managers *fear* that the overall stock market will fall but *want* to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts
many investment managers *say* futures *are* useful as a way to hedge portfolios
if managers *fear* that the overall stock market will fall but *want* to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts
and although criticism of futures generally *comes* from wall street one chicago futures trader *notes* that brokerage firms *rely* on futures as hedging tools when they *buy* and *sell* big blocks of stocks from institutions
one reason futures *are* said to add volatility *is* that unlike in stocks people can speculate in futures with little money down
margin requirements for speculators on the chicago mercantile exchange *are* currently about N N
that *gives* futures traders a lot more power
some critics *say* futures *encourage* people to think of stocks as a single commodity rather than as investments in individual businesses
thus they *say* futures *inhibit* the basic purpose of the stock market to accurately price securities so that capital and investment *flows* where it *'s* needed most
but owning index futures *is* n't the same as owning the underlying stocks
stockholders as a group can win because they *own* a share of corporate earnings which can grow and boost stock prices
futures on the other hand *are* a zero sum game a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices
you *do* n't own anything *says* stephen boesel a money manager for t. rowe price in baltimore
you *'re* making a pure bet on the market
the ec commission decided that such an accord *does* n't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law
an air france spokeswoman said we *'re* absolutely ready to study all solutions

gm sought u.s. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $ N million worth of jaguar shares but *does* n't own any yet according to gm officials here and at the company 's detroit headquarters
the no. N u.s. auto maker then wrote jaguar that it *intends* to go to that N N level once it *wins* the u.s. clearance to go beyond $ N million a jaguar spokesman said yesterday
the gm move *follows* tuesday 's declaration by ford which *holds* an unwelcome N N stake in jaguar that it *is* prepared to bid for the entire company
gm **is** close to completing a friendly deal with jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual N N stake and joint manufacturing ventures
since tuesday the shares *have* gained nearly N N
there *'s* some price at which we 'd stop bidding
and powerful political pressures may convince the conservative government to keep its so-called golden share which *limits* any individual holding to N N until the restriction *expires* on dec. N N
i really *do* n't see the government doing something that jaguar *does* n't want over the next N months said kenneth warren a conservative member of parliament and chairman of the select committee on trade and industry in britain 's house of commons
the golden share **is** a single share but it is the magic share
the N N restriction *covers* any would-be suitor british or foreign
ford might succeed because many sh*are*holders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties
politics also *influences* the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction
skf said demand for the group 's main product rolling bearings remained favorable in europe which *accounts* for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales
the company said the situation in the u.s. *is* still uncertain as reduced production in the country 's automotive industry *has* resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings

while utah *is* not yet a *have*n for environmentalism public views toward the environment have significantly improved
an excellent environmental actor he *is*
but the two-day trip still *has* managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's policies in central america
some conservatives *say* mr. bush should n't make the trip during which he will participate in costa rica 's celebration of N years of democracy
these critics *object* to mr. bush 's participation in a meeting that *includes* nicaraguan president daniel *ortega* among the guests
mr. windsor among other analysts connected to the conservative heritage foundation *fears* the gathering of N leaders mostly from central american nations will force mr. bush to explain and redeem himself in the wake of charges that the u.s. failed to do enough to aid the removal of panamanian dictator manuel noriega
at the same time liberal and moderate democrats *note* the irony of mr. bush 's joining a celebration of costa rican democracy at a time his administration *has* sought sharp cuts in u.s. aid to the tiny country
the administration said improvements in costa rica 's economic condition *warrant* the cut in aid which the country *uses* mainly to make payments on its $ N billion foreign debt
i *think* bush 's going there *is* a helpful sign said sen. terry sanford d. n.c a member of the foreign relations committee who pushed to provide costa rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year
lawmakers in both houses *support* the higher level
administration officials *defend* mr. bush 's decision to make the trip
i *suspect* i may be one of the few people to have read them all
the sixth and last report now *is* out and it *puts* the effort in perspective
it *'s* little less than a cry for help from those who *make* the costly show possible
but even those numbers **do** n't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words
football *is* the no. N thing here
first the sport you *play* *is* no longer a game it *becomes* a job
your coaches *demand* a lot more out of you even though some of them *are* not willing to take the time to watch you progress
your interest *is* not taken to heart because people only care about your performance
in other words they *treat* you like a piece of meat
we *are* almost left out of campus social activities
this mostly *happens* because we *go* from football in the fall to lifting in the winter to football again in the spring
there *is* no recovery period it *'s* go go go

alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge alone *is* thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil

similarly a group of companies led by chevron corp. *has* been unable to pump oil found off the california coast in the early 1980s
we *'re* trying to get it on line as soon as possible now
the proposals *go* far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika mikhail gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy
for example the proposed overhaul of prices an extremely sensitive political topic *is* far more precise than the vague plans announced by mr. gorbachev in N and later dropped
the document *is* to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month and will probably be presented to the soviet parliament for consideration this year
but it *hints* strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies *take* effect
*do* n't worry people will learn to read as long as there *are* tv program listings

meanwhile the government 's land bureau *reports* that only about a third of korean families *own* their own homes

led by the federation of korean industries the critics *are* lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties
mr. lee *estimates* that about N property speculators *are* operating in south korea
the ministry of finance as a result *has* proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals
under those measures financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they *need* for their business operations
banks investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to N N of their capital currently the proportion *is* N N
but mrs. park *acknowledges* that even if the policies *work* to slow or stop speculation apartment prices *are* unlikely to go down

colombia alone its government its people its newspapers *does* not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully
there *has* been a lot of talk that a large portion of the colombian economy *is* sustained by the laundering of drug money
in my opinion th*is* is not true
but most of the drug money *is* kept in investments and in financial institutions outside colombia
in fact the cooperation of those financial institutions *is* essential to the success of the drug battle
the price of coffee *has* gone down almost N N since the beginning of the year to the lowest level after inflation since the great depression

mr. *dinkins* lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in N
but board members *say* he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided it was too late to try to draw other members to his position
mr. *dinkins* 's campaign manager and former chief of staff bill lynch *denies* that the manhattan borough president *has* taken too long to decide important issues
on some occasions when mr. *dinkins* **has** discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble
he *favors* a form of commercial rent control which the financial community *believes* would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city
in the midst of a labor shortage he *proposes* linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new york city residents
and he *favors* a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of new jersey and connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of new york city
the key man *seems* to be the campaign manager mr. lynch
some business leaders and others also *believe* that mr. dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background

the N mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds *hold* assets of about $ N billion
he *adds* our fund *has* had positive net sales every month for the last three years until this month
the fund now *holds* a cash position of about N N
through oct. N high-yield funds had an average N N total *return* the price change plus dividends on fund shares according to lipper analytical services inc
that *'s* even less than the N N total return of the merrill *lynch* high-yield index
fidelity 's junk fund *has* fallen N N this year through oct. N lipper *says* the vanguard fund rose N N and the t. rowe price fund edged up N N
people who *remain* in junk funds now could get hit again some analysts and fund specialists *say*

i *agree* it *'s* ridiculous *says* mr. boren and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the u.s. *decides* to take or rather not to take covert action
i really *want* to see that happen again
but in N most senators *have* other ideas
mr. boren **does** n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month but he does concede that congress *has* made mistakes
in the aftermath of vietnam in the aftermath of iran-contra i can understand some people might think that if they *plan* a coup they *have* to bring their lawyers he *says*
writing in the harvard international review he *says* that his committee *approves* covert operations only when there *'s* a consensus
so what *does* consensus mean
mr. boren *is* confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions
the result *is* that the senate committee *has* what *amounts* to veto power over every covert action
but that *is* something the president ought to know before he *goes* ahead
he *points* to a letter on his desk his second in a week from president bush saying that they *do* n't disagree
more broadly mr. boren *hopes* that panama will shock washington out of its fear of using military power

miami-based carnival said the first of the three ships *is* scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean
the second ship *is* scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N
all the ships *are* covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency even though it *'s* not clear whether they will actually be built
state loan guarantees *are* rarely a source of controversy
doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of finn*is*h companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders analysts *warn*
moreover state-owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets bankers *say*

it **'s** difficult to see that there 's going to be enough business to go around

and defense lawyers *are* warning that they wo n't stick around if they *do* n't get paid
the warning by the u.s. attorney 's office *follows* two decisions by the u.s. supreme court last june
in those cases the high court ruled that federal law *gives* prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment
a seizure also would make the case the largest and one of the first in which lawyers ' fees *have* been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs
mr. antar *is* being investigated by a federal grand jury in newark where prosecutors *have* told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges
therefore they said the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they *are* paid
through his lawyers *mr.* antar *has* denied allegations in the sec suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against mr. antar and others
the sec *has* alleged that mr. antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits
mr. *antar* the sec said made more than $ N million from the sale of his shares between N and N
according to department policy prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure *are* made
still criminal defense lawyers *worry* that defendants *are* being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees
in general markets *function* well and *adjust* smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances
that *'s* just what happened in the october N crash
it *'s* *do*ubtful though whether circuit breakers do any real good
in the additional time they *provide* even more order imbalances might pile up as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone
the fed *has* assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities
this **does** not mean that the federal reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market
the fed also *has* the power to set margin requirements
the stock market *is* certainly not too big for the fed to handle
daily trading volume in the new york foreign exchange market *is* $ N billion

his remarks were distributed to the press before chancellor of the exchequer *nigel* lawson announced his resignation last evening
however in light of the risks involved in such transactions banks should satisfy themselves that they *have* the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions he said
intel corp. 's most powerful computer chip *has* flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts but the bugs *are* n't expected to hurt intel and most computer makers
computer experts familiar with the flaws found in intel 's N chip *say* the defects *do* n't affect the average user and *are* likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their brains *appear* on the market sometime next year
but while international business machines corp. and compaq computer corp. *say* the bugs will delay products most big computer makers said the flaws *do* n't affect them
these bugs *do* n't affect our schedule at all he said
we *have* n't modified our schedules in any way said a sun spokesman
most of compaq 's decline *is* being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations
we should not be seeing any more said bill *rash* intel 's director for the N chip
you can do that but you *'re* taking a risk
those companies *are* paying the price for taking the risk
an ibm spokeswoman said the company told customers *monday* about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product
we *do* n't look at this as a major problem for us she said
compaq which said it discovered the bugs still *plans* to announce new N products on nov. N
that *'s* a break from compaq tradition because the company *does* n't announce products until they *'re* actually at the dealers
that *'s* four times as fast as the N

wall street analysts *have* criticized bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones
it *'s* important to share the risk and even more so when the market *has* already peaked
he said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies *one* that could open up new markets for bethlehem
if you *'re* still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market consider the case of columbia savings & loan
the california thrift *has* just announced a $ N million third-quarter loss
well when congress in its recent s&l bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by N it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts *have* made
i *believe* we *have* to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court through justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies
i *see* congress as a last resort
but the pullout *is* an embarrassment to new york city officials coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies

in testimony to the senate securities subcommittee *mr.* brady disputed the view of sec chairman richard breeden who told a house panel wednesday that he *does* n't want the ability to halt the markets
he added that the president already *has* the power to close the markets in an emergency
but mr. brady argued that the sec *is* closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges *are* under such stress that they should be closed
separately mr. brady said he asked the working group on financial markets to determine whether futures margins *are* too low
he noted that some minimum margin requirements *have* been reduced to levels below those before the N crash
this *raises* questions whether futures and equity margin requirements **are** consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate mr. brady said
margins *are* the amount of money an investor *needs* to put up to buy or sell a futures contract
margins on the futures exchanges typically *are* raised and lowered according to market volatility
mr. brady also said he *expects* the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to end under its own weight
asked whether there *is* anything congress should do to curb the lbo boom mr. brady responded i *think* the lbo phenomenon while it wo n't stop completely will be a thing of the past
before taking any action he advised the panel to see what the market *has* produced as a cure
but he added that individuals still *are* participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds
the former wall street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading which **has** recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago
i *do* not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time he said
that bill proposed by the sec last year would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies *mandate* large traders ' reporting of program or block trades and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets
the senate agriculture committee *is* responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the futures trading practices act of N
however as *is* common with sweeping legislation the proposal *contains* many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it *sets* out to preserve
indeed some of the bill 's requirements including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest already *have* been put in place by the coffee sugar & cocoa exchange and other futures exchanges
other aspects of the bill however **are** either structured in ways that *create* unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges the industry and ultimately the general public
one of the most prominent features *is* the requirement that in three years all exchanges *have* in place a system that *records* all trades by a source independent of the executing broker
the new york futures exchanges *have* been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill
what if the system *does* n't work
what if the only system that *does* work *is* so expensive that at best only the largest exchanges can afford it
cost *is* a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets
the u.s. futures exchanges *compete* world-wide as never before
in fact several london markets already *offer* lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts
the senate bill *contains* many provisions that will increase the costs of trading
these *include* the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages
it *is* only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation
another measure *makes* commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who *execute* trades for them
this would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that *function* as floor brokers
the affected practices *include* the placing of oral orders which *is* the way most public customer orders *are* placed and trading between affiliated brokers even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client
all u.s. futures exchanges *agree* that these and other trading practices *require* proper regulation and supervision
nonetheless each *has* too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the cftc c*are*fully *considers* all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are
the markets *are* complex as *is* the environment in which they *function*
these figures *are* n't seasonally adjusted
while the theme *is* compelling the plot and characters *are* not

so i *think* the conceptual base *needs* to be thought out in a different way
i *find* it very difficult to say that
they *do* n't even want to talk to you
no politician *wants* to say what i just said not for a minute
although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter many analysts *expect* it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos *falls* partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month
and business investment which slowed in the third quarter according to yesterday 's report *is* expected to continue to be sluggish
an inflation gauge that *measures* the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a N N annual rate in the third quarter from N N in the second

generally the bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it *heads* into its eighth year of sustained growth next month
treasury secretary nicholas brady called the N N pace good solid growth although he said he *expects* the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter
he added inflation *is* lower than i **think** people expected it to be and i think that *'s* good news
i ca n't believe it will continue he added noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners **are** strong and prices of u.s. products are still competitive

mr. fournier said that as navigation mixte chairman he *is* prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business
but sources said he will be urging h**is** allies to boost their stakes in navigation mixte which is being traded in london and is to resume trading in paris tuesday
at the same time he *is* expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying paribas 's bid
that *is* due mostly to payments from allianz for most of the N N stake it *has* agreed to acquire in navigation mixte 's insurance business
this time however some analysts *think* he could face a real battle
one big question now *is* the likely role of mr. fournier 's allies
mr. fournier said the large institutions that *hold* nearly N N of navigation mixte 's capital all strongly support him but some analysts said they *are* n't so sure
allianz for example *has* said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral
paribas *is* allianz 's lead french bank
paribas said monday that it *intends* to bid to boost its stake in navigation mixte to N N from the N N it already *owns*

democratic leaders *have* bottled up president bush 's capital-gains tax cut in the senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely
senate majority leader george mitchell *d.* maine said he *intends* to use senate procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least N *votes* before they can address the issue
and neither democrats nor republicans *are* predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes
they *do* n't have the votes to get it passed
i *'m* not sure what *'s* going to happen he said
th*is* is serious business we *'re* serious about a capital-gains reduction said kansas sen. robert dole the senate 's republican leader
the strategy *is* let 's vote

when he met w*i*th mr. bush on his return mr. lee *says* he told the president that the chinese made statements to me that i *regard* as a first step toward reconciliation
the communication mr. lee brought *represents* the softer line the u.s. *has* been hoping to hear from chinese officials since the june N massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing
mr. deng added *says* mr. lee that we really made mistakes
mr. lee *concedes* the statements made to him *are* far different from others being *is*sued in china but *attributes* that to the fact that the situation in china is very complex
the president *does* n't want to have legislative sanctions *says* a u.s. official
sentences *have* been stiff
what *'s* more much of china 's official rhetoric *is* hostile to the u.s.

but for soviet citizens who *travel* abroad for business or tourism the rate will jump to N rubles to the dollar
but it did n't elaborate and it *remains* unclear how far western tourists and foreigners living in moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut
the current ruble rate *has* long been out of line with the black market
the going rate for a small personal computer that *costs* about $ N in the west *is* anywhere from N to N rubles
the state bank 's move **is** part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible a goal that soviet bankers and economists *say* is still far away
rumors of an impending devaluation *have* been circulating in moscow for weeks but the size of the cut took many western bankers by surprise
it *'s* much bigger than we expected said one german banker who asked not to be named
the next step which could have a larger effect on businesses will come early next month when the bank for foreign economic affairs *is* to hold its first auction of foreign currency
soviet firms that *hold* some **are** unwilling to part with it and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate
the kremlin also *has* been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods
but the amounts they *exchange* may be limited most soviet hotels for example demand payment in hard currency from western visitors
unless other rules *are* changed the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it *is* primarily meant to help soviets who *travel* abroad
but under current rules they *are* allowed to change just N *rubles* into dollars and other currencies for each trip
but the computer giant *appears* to have lost a second key contract with kodak to archrival digital equipment corp
ibm *is* based in armonk n.y
the loss *is* a setback to ibm which pointed to the kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration
a kodak spokesman declined to d*is*close the potential value of the contract which is still in negotiation
that *'s* why we went with ibm for data center management and now digital for voice and data telecommunications
in earlier years it may *have* seemed reasonable to give richmond va. a bank and allow los angeles only a branch of the san francisco bank but times have changed
some of the would-be reformers however *want* to restore an arrangement we once had or at least part of it
times *have* changed
there *is* doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least congress as in N would be doing something
so far no one *has* suggested putting the comptroller back on the board
nicholas *brady* the incumbent treasury secretary *is* of course aware of the proposal and he *does* n't like it much
like most treasury secretaries *mr.* brady *takes* a keen interest in monetary matters of course
the fed *has* plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in N and again in N it *appears* to have handled them well
mr. brady **has** said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions but he has left no doubt that he still *likes* the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago
in recent weeks moreover *mr.* brady *has* joined other administration officials in trying to urge the fed toward lower interest rates
in an interview with the washington post in early october the secretary said the fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the admin*is*tration is while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth
at least some economists of course would argue that inflation *deserves* a lot of emphasis
the treasury can do something on its own but to have any hope of success it *needs* help from the fed
the dollar *is* still highly volatile
the fed *has* let interest rates *slip* slightly but whether the main reason was dollar intervention the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment or the friday N market drop only *mr.* greenspan and his associates *know*
the more we *think* about it the more we *suspect* mr. brady *does* indeed have enough power where he already *is*
our ability to influence the outcome of events in eastern europe and the soviet union *is* far more marginal
those events *continue* to move at a rate and in a direction which *leave* informed commentary let alone policy far in their wake
all of th**is** is what history will note assuming that events *do* n't make it seem a bad joke when the record of this time is put down
primarily because there *'s* more to the matter than *ronald* reagan 's personal values or lack of them
there *is* evidence to support that view
if there *is* no law against it *do* it
we *have* people in high place still lying through their teeth about iran-contra and that apparently *is* n't going to change
that *is* the key to the current national disease
you *are* mad because he *'s* making so much money *say* president reagan 's defenders
the directors added that the two executives *have* n't reached a final dec*is*ion to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders

the american proposal *is* not an adequate basis for negotiation the ec said in a statement
but the ec *is* strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs
the new u.s. package also *says* countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they *experience* an unusually heavy volume of imports
the ec with a population of N million **has** N million farmers while the u.s. with a population of about N million has only two million farmers

lawrence perlman control *data* 's president and chief operating officer said the maintenance business no longer *fits* into the company 's strategy to be a data solutions company
these decisions *deserve* more attention than they *have* received from scholars and from journalists as well
this was too much for james *oakes* the court 's chief judge
and when responsible scholars *gain* legitimate access to unpublished materials copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that *help* to establish historical points
yet at the moment they **are** the judges who are making the law
the courts *have* not def*i*ned minimal amounts but publishers i *understand* take it to mean about N words
the bare-faced messiah decision *strikes* a blow against the whole historical enterprise
the quotes could not be found on the tapes and the two judges who decided the case for ms. malcolm and her publishers conceded that for the purpose of their decision we *assume* the quotations were deliberately altered
no such statement *appears* on the tapes
again no such statement *appears* on the tapes
we now *know* that the words were not always his own
masson *has* lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they *belong* *have* lost far more

dr. morgan *is* a highly educated white professional who attended some of the best schools

they *are* also indirectly subject to approval by the state of new hampshire where residents *fear* soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization
each of the four parties bidding for ps of new hampshire **proposes** a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state
united illuminating 's plan however *offers* more for unsecured creditors
as previously reported northeast utilities *hartford* conn. monday filed a bid it valued at $ N billion
new england electric **values** its offer at $ N billion and ps of new hampshire values its reorganization plan at $ N billion
however creditors and bidders alike *concede* that the state *plays* a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it did n't like
the state *has* endorsed the new england electric plan which *promises* to limit rate increases to N N annually for seven years
northeast utilities ' plan *proposes* N N annual increases
the bids and rate proposals generally *assume* the seabrook nuclear power plant which *is* completed will go into operation

in an interview and in congressional testimony he repeatedly *points* to the recent 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average the second-largest ever as evidence of the need for congress to give the sec the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market
a veteran of another financial crisis the savings-and-loan bailout mr. breeden *wants* to have the sec regulate securities issued by banks and s&ls

he also *has* kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission a job vacant since the summer
congress *seems* likely to let the new chairman *have* his way for a while
i *do* n't think this was a real test *says* one congressional aide
they *worry* that mr. breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the white house
but mr. breeden already *has* shown an eagerness to run the sec his way
it was the plunge that did n't happen he *says*
mr. breeden also *is* trying to use a far more catastrophic event the california earthquake to move another rule change past congress

what *seem* to be interpreted as great conflicts *are* relatively minor issues of tactics he said
but the fed **is** n't enthusiastic about treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets and the treasury is frustrated at the fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value
mr. greenspan said the inflation rate currently about N N N could be brought *do*wn to levels which *are* close to zero without putting the economy into a recession but i do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output
but mr. *greenspan* who *has* repeatedly said the fed 's goal *is* to reduce inflation added that whatever losses *are* incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter

the broker winning the business *does* n't charge commissions but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price

the dow average now *stands* more than N N higher while renaissance 's portfolio of treasurys produced a return of about N N through the first three quarters of the year
almost any money manager holding stocks **has** turned in better results while renaissance has played it safe with treasury bills
so why *does* renaissance 's computer like stocks with the dow at N where it closed yesterday when it did n't with the dow at N
stock prices meanwhile *are* about N points lower than the peak of N reached on the dow industrial average oct. N
*are* those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks

the sept. N tracking travel column *advises* readers to *charge* with caution when traveling abroad because credit-card companies charge N N to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars
in fact th*is* is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad
in contrast to the N N conversion fee *charge*d by visa foreign-currency dealers routinely charge N N or more to convert u.s. dollars into foreign currency
the card holder will pay the modest N N *fee* only on the amounts actually needed

the average seven-day compound yield which *assumes* that dividends *are* reinvested and that current rates *continue* for a year fell to N N its lowest since late last year from N N the week before according to donoghue 's
money funds *invest* in such things as short-term treasury securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit all of which *have* been posting lower interest rates since last spring
one way that money fund managers *boost* yields in a declining rate environment *is* by extending the maturities of their investments so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period
the average maturity of the taxable funds that *donoghue* 's *follows* increased by two days in the latest week to N days its longest since august

these people invested in leveraged junk bond mutual funds the publicly traded funds that *make* a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk
it *'s* a good strategy in a rising market where a N N leveraged portfolio in effect *allows* investors to have N N of their money working for them
the strategy *boosts* current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio
trouble *is* junk bond prices *have* been weak for months
and shares of leveraged junk funds this year *have* been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they *hold*
share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values because fear *has* taken hold in the junk market he *says*
leverage *is* never a problem for the traditional open end mutual funds which **are** n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all
leverage *is* used only by some of the closed-end funds
the usual maneuver *is* to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock using the proceeds to buy additional bonds
the fallout for investors lately *has* been painful
with a leveraged position of about N N the fund 's share price *has* plunged N N so far this year
in a typical leverage strategy a fund *tries* to capture the spread between what it *costs* to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it *buys* with the borrowed money
but when the market *moves* against the fund investors *lose* more than other junk holders because the market decline **is** magnified by the amount the fund is leveraged
fund managers for their part *defend* their use of leverage
new america high income fund recently said that it *plans* to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ N million in preferred stock and notes from investors
ms. terry did say the fund 's recent performance *illustrates* what *happens* in a leveraged product when the market *does* n't cooperate
when the market *turns* around she *says* it will give a nice picture of how leverage can help performance
several leveraged funds *do* n't want to cut the amount they *borrow* because it would slash the income they *pay* shareholders fund officials said
but a few funds *have* taken other defensive steps
some *have* raised their cash positions to record levels
high cash positions *help* buffer a fund when the market *falls*
he *says* the fund which *is* N N leveraged *has* maintained a substantial cushion between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds
other funds *have* recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash

rep. edward markey d. mass. chairman of the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee *is* pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb turmoil in the marketplace
he argued that program-trading by roughly N big institutions *is* pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors
after the sec study of the drop *is* completed he said i *'m* perfectly happy to work with this committee in identifying whether we *need* other devices such as a program-trading curb
the measure *is* expected to move through this congress
mr. *breeden* offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill

senate democrats who *favor* cutting the capital-gains tax *are* n't ready to line up behind the leading senate proposal

mr. *packwood* all but conceded defeat tell*i*ng mr. mitchell i sense at this stage you may have the votes
president bush *has* been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with democratic senators at the white house
the trend *is* making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success
other democrats who *favor* a capital-gains cut *are* even more pessimistic
i *'m* probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal
as a result the officials said they *are* open to making a variety of deals with senate democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut
other possibilities *include* a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage
if they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan administration officials also *are* n't ruling out making a deal with congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future even next year

people *wonder* what *'s* going to happen next
many manufacturers *are* worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to campeau stores
the few million dollars i could lose today *is* nothing against what i could lose on the spring line *says* mr. levy who *estimates* that campeau stores will sell $ N million worth of his clothes this year
*i* *'m* buying fabric right now for clothes which i may not be paid for until april or may
campeau *has* too much debt
other credit houses such as credit exchange and solo credit service corp. *are* suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping
payments **are** good right now but we are n't recommending any long-term lines of credit *says* richard hastings a retail credit analyst referring to credit lines which *make* inventory purchases automatic
the campeau situation *is* a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze
because of those concerns some manufacturers *say* they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise
we **'re** being paid today but we 're worried about tomorrow and will want letters of credit *says* the sales director at one major dress maker who asked not to be identified
i *'m* going to ship and hope i get paid
if i *need* to ask for money up front later i will
we *'re* confident we 'll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well

what that will mean for manufacturers *is* anybody 's guess
campeau 's financial situation *is* complicated by an estimated $ N billion in debt due next spring
the company *has* stated in recently filed financial documents that it *anticipates* refinancing its march N payments
those filings plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains such as saks *fifth* *avenue* marshall field 's and bloomingdale 's *have* added to the anxiety

separately two more of the nation 's top steelmakers *armco* inc. and national intergroup inc. reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses marking what *is* generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry
wall street analysts *expect* the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of N when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines such as rolled sheet used for cars appliances and construction
in fact he *thinks* several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of N
of all the major steelmakers *bethlehem* would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown
it **has** n't diversified beyond steel nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks
still bethlehem *'s* core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $ N million from $ N million a year ago when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing
we *anticipate* that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector *remains* weak and customers *continue* to adjust inventories said bethlehem chairman walter f. williams
he noted however that the company 's order entry *has* increased from the low levels of the early summer following the end of labor negotiations
national intergroup which *owns* N N of the nation 's sixth largest steelmaker national steel corp. posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a net loss of $ N million
the latest period *includes* gains of $ N million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward

failure of u.s. equipment makers *ibm* fears would leave it dependent on many of the japanese companies that *compete* with it in other parts of the market
ibm also said it *expects* to benefit from the expertise that motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing

some people familiar with the situation *believe* that the collapse of the previous $ N billion buy-out if anything may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups
united pilots *have* shown on a number of occasions they *are* willing and able to strike said an executive at fuji bank one of ual 's large lenders
if you *have* both labor groups on strike you *'ve* got no revenue and that *'s* a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at
the two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer *has* yet to settle with either on new contracts
that *gives* them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work
thus even investors who **are** pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake *acknowledge* that the unions are key
mr. nye *thinks* the ual board should be ousted if it *does* n't move soon to increase shareholder value
both the pilots and machinists *have* made it clear that they *intend* to block any transaction they *do* n't like
on the other hand the machinists *have* always opposed majority ownership in principle saying they *do* n't think employees should be owners
still in recent days machinists ' union leaders *have* shown some new flexibility
mr. freeman said machinists ' union advisers *plan* to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders an employee stake and perhaps an equity investment by a friendly investor
if a compromise ca n't be reached the pilots *maintain* they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists
who would the board be working for the public shareholders or the pilots she *adds*
she also *notes* that even if the pilots *accept* a minority stake now they still could come back at a later time and try to take control
in that way the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that *gives* employees a majority stake or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal
i *think* the dynamics of this situation *are* that something 's got to happen said one official familiar with the situation
the board and ual 's management he *says* ca n't go back to business as usual

the loss *stems* from $ N million of write-downs on columbia 's $ N billion high-yield investment securities portfolio which *includes* about $ N billion of junk bonds $ N million of preferred stock and treasury securities
columbia *owes* its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio the largest of any u.s. thrift
much of columbia 's junk-bond trading *has* been done through the high-yield department of its beverly hills neighbor *drexel* burnham lambert inc
the results *include* a $ N million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value
because columbia now must sell the bonds within five years accounting rules *require* the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices
thomas *spiegel* columbia 's chairman said in a statement that the thrift was disappointed by the effects of the accounting changes
but he said columbia *remains* one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital
the price of columbia shares *has* been cut nearly in half since august when they traded at about $ N as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down
the thrift emp**has**ized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs which has a book value of $ N million
although many of the transactions related to those securities *have* n't been completed columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $ N million to $ N million

the big board this morning *plans* to begin trading its exchange stock portfolio basket product the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval
new sec chairman richard breeden overseeing his first public meeting said there *have* been concerns that the big board 's basket could attract investors with a short-term perspective who would rapidly turn over the product thus increasing volatility
the baskets on the big board and cboe which *involve* the actual s&p stocks unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the chicago futures markets and index options on the cboe will begin trading as critics *step* up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings

the new stock baskets *are* going to make it easier for program trading to be done
and it *'s* going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places
both the big board 's exchange stock portfolio and the chicago exchange 's market basket *are* designed for institutional investors
the big board *lists* its targets as pension plans mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders

kidder peabody & co. a general electric co. unit that *has* become the biggest program trader along with morgan stanley *is* n't a market maker although the big board *hopes* that will change
neither *has* plans to be a market maker for now
traders said major securities firms *are* reluctant to become market makers because they *fear* the baskets may attract only limited trading
big board officials *say* only N contracts a day may trade at first equivalent to a day 's action at a small regional exchange
even though the big board *says* its product *represents* a post-crash reform some traders *suggest* that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's friday the 13th market plunge the dow jones industrial average might have dropped more than the N points it did
with the futures locked into a trading halt oct. N and trading in some individual stock difficult program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system the traders *say*

the loss in comprehensive care 's latest quarter *is* equal to N cents a share
comprehensive care said first hospital had adv*is*ed it that both bank debt and senior notes would be repaid after the acquisition although it is n't assured the acquisition will be completed

first hospital adv*is*ed comprehensive care that an agent for the financial institutions providing financing of its acquisition is scheduled to make a final credit determination tomorrow and that a favorable determination could result in a reorganization at comprehensive care by the end of october

after coming close to a partial settlement a year ago sh*are*holders who filed civil suits against ivan f. boesky and the partnerships he once controlled again are approaching an accord people familiar with the case said
meanwhile within the next few weeks the limited partners in ivan f. boesky & co l.p. *are* expected to reach a partial settlement with drexel burnham lambert inc. regarding the distribution of the $ N million in partnership assets said one of the individuals
the plaintiffs *are* investors who bought and sold securities in which mr. boesky and his partnerships were dealing
there *are* no agreements yet
it *has* been three years since mr. boesky now in prison agreed to pay a $ N million fine to settle the government 's charges that he had traded illegally using insider information
separately attorneys for the N or so limited partners *have* had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership 's assets
the limited partners *include* insurance companies financial institutions and individual investors
an agreement with drexel regarding the limited partners ' investments *is* an essential step toward getting their money back
th**is** is because a delaware court earlier this year said that drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners
drexel *is* owed $ N million by the partnership
drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $ N million of which $ N million was set aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs including the limited partners who *claim* they were injured by drexel

sotheby 's holdings *inc.* the parent of the auction house sotheby 's said its net loss for the seasonally slow third quarter narrowed from a year earlier on a leap in operating revenue
the company said N N of its auction business *is* usually conducted in the second and fourth quarters with the current quarter having begun extremely well
and now that the price *has* fallen below $ N which many had said showed considerable resistance some traders and analysts *figure* there *'s* little to stop the price from going lower on technical decisions
estimates *suggest* october *'s* figure may be even higher
that level of production *is* n't of much concern as long as demand *continues* strong analysts said
also maintaining current demand *assumes* no significant slowdown in world economies

the downgrade *anticipates* completion of the ima holdings acquisition today moody 's said
the ratings concern said the acquisition should result in pretax losses from operations because of increases in interest expense and charges for depreciation and amortization but that it *expects* the losses to be reduced through productivity gains and above average growth of the company 's hospitals

japan 's steelmakers *are* raising capital spending N N this year to $ N billion
many japanese companies *expect* record profits this fiscal year and japanese interest rates though up a bit recently *are* still low
they *fear* that the boom may be too big for japan 's or anyone else 's good
the min*is*try of international trade and industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending
not everyone *is* worried however
the investment boom **is** mainly sparked they *say* by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply
moreover much investment *is* n't aimed at increasing capacity
according to a survey of some N large companies by the japan development bank expanded capacity **is** the goal of just N N of the outlays for manufacturers alone the figure is N N
the manufacturers said N N of their spending ****is**** designed to improve products or add new ones N N is to cut costs N N is for research and development and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes
with japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world they *think* that japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more
japanese auto makers for example *are* increasing their production capacity in the u.s. the additional production should in part replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones
many *are* pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and to some extent to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from south korea and taiwan
others *are* replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once
once one japanese company *steps* up its investments the whole industry *follows*

a major tokyo newspaper reported that a japanese department store concern *is* planning to offer about $ N billion to buy bloomingdale 's
campeau *corp.* the chain 's owner declined to comment on the report
th*is* is the first of many rumors we *expect* to hear during the sale 's process said a bloomingdale 's spokesman
among previously d*is*closed possible bidders is bloomingdale 's chairman marvin traub who *has* aligned himself with drexel burnham lambert inc. and blackstone group
investment bankers in tokyo confirmed that tokyu department store *is* one of several japanese companies that *has* been approached by representatives of a management committee headed by bloomingdale 's mr. traub
but they said detailed financial figures *have* n't been passed yet to any prospective buyers
nobody *is* going to make a real bid before the middle of november said one investment banker familiar with the discussions in japan
tokyu *is* one of the potential buyers who might raise its hand
but it *'s* in very early stages still
bloomingdale 's *does* an estimated $ N billion in annual sales
the sale of bloomingdale 's *is* a condition of efforts by toronto-based olympia & york developments *ltd.* to arrange $ N million in bridge financing for campeau which disclosed last month that its retailing units federated department stores *inc.* and allied stores *corp.* were strapped for cash
one executive familiar with the bloomingdale 's situation said no book **has** been issued regarding bloomingdale 's there *are* no projections so i *doubt* very much whether any bid has been made
the suit *says* the company failed to disclose material adverse information about its financial condition
a spokesman for the company said campeau *has* n't seen the suit and declined to comment
mccaw cellular communications *inc.* must extend its offer for lin broadcasting corp. because it *has* not yet announced committed financing sufficient to complete the bid lin said in new york
mccaw 's offer *is* scheduled to expire tomorrow

the good news to fans of stable credit at least *is* what the rejection *says* about the state of mind of junk buyers
app*are*ntly they are learning to say no to excess risk
coniston partners which with related entities *controls* N N of tw had been planning to sell $ N billion of junk bonds among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares
tw 's junk bonds were n't as junk bonds *go* unusually weak
a dlj banker putting a best possible face on it *asserts* that very few people said they did n't like the credit quality
but trading risk *stems* from credit risk
as he *sums* it up we *are* listening to the market
what *is* it to borrow a term from coniston that so unsettled the market
the tw prospectus *says* that if the acquisition had been completed earlier pretax earnings would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges including interest on debt securities by approximately $ N million in the first six months of N
tw 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants *have* risen steadily and that people wo n't stop eating during a downturn
we were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt *says* a big investor in high-yield debt
dlj *argues* that tw could if necessary cut capital spending since half of what it *plans* to spend *is* for growth rather than maintenance

mr. pound responded it *'s* a deal
but mr. pilson *has* been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid
cbs itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble *goes* wrong
if they *ask* advertisers to absorb the costs they *'re* likely to lose all but a few who *need* sports above all
cbs *has* changed the rules by throwing out the old bas*is* for sports bids that is can the network alone make a profit on it
the billion-dollar question *is* how much *are* those benefits *worth*
as we *'ve* seen in the '80s *says* roger werner the president of the espn sports *channel* those deals can turn sour if the numbers *do* n't work
and they *'ve* bought one
on just three big deals for four years of baseball and for the olympic winter games in both N and N *pilson* bid a total of $ N billion
that *'s* well over half a billion dollars more than abc and nbc were willing to pay
cbs *is* likely to spend whatever it *takes* to keep them
a few months later *cbs* 's college and pro football contracts *come* up for renewal they could go for close to $ N million more than cbs now *pays* a N N to N N rise
and yet h*is* company is one reason why rights *are* so high today
mr. *pilson* *says* that when he spoke out a few years ago i did n't say forever and i did n't say every property
the market changed he *adds*
maybe we *recognize* values the other guys *do* n't mr. pilson *says*
mr. *tisch* a billionaire in hotels and finance was just learning the tv business
it *'s* also a fast fix for an ailing image
that *is* n't surprising
but top sports events *are* still a strong bet to lure audiences N N or N N larger than those cbs usually *gets*
it *'s* made me more committed to cbs *says* philip a. *jones* the president of meredith corp. 's broadcast group which *has* two cbs affiliates
the cbs plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series *carries* no guarantee of success however
if the show *ai* n't a killer they *'re* gone
moreover sports *is* hardly the best way to lure adult women
though cbs might move up to no. N in household ratings most advertisers *buy* based on ratings for women aged N to N
you *'ve* got to judge where the network will be in three years
it *'s* too early to tell what *happens* after that he *says*
but mr. tisch *expects* losses in all four years of the contract he told u.s. senators last june
cbs will pay an average of $ N million more each year than abc and nbc had paid together and those two networks *expect* losses on baseball this season
the winter games outlook also *is* mixed
cbs *expects* to make modest profits but rivals *contend* that it will take a beating
barry frank the agent who took mr. pilson to lunch last march **say*s* that even if cbs loses say $ N million it *matters* little
ten million *ai* n't jack man when you got $ N billion sitting in the bank *says* mr. frank senior vice president at international management group citing cbs 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses
it *does* n't mean anything it *'s* public-relations money
and cbs *takes* in the least money in prime time abc and nbc charge N N to N N more for ads according to a variety survey
cbs *hopes* to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time
when mr. pilson *is* asked directly can you make money on all this he *does* n't exactly say yes
what you *'re* really asking *is* *are* the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management he *says*
then he *answers* his own question
yes they *are*
that *'s* the only question we *need* to address
place a phone order through most any catalog and chances *are* the clerk who *answers* wo n't be the only one on the line

among companies saying they *monitor* employees *are* united airlines american airlines united parcel service nynex *corp.* spiegel inc. and the circulation department of this newspaper
shearson *says* it *has* taped some of its institutional trading desks such as commodities and futures for about four years
both companies *stress* that employees *know* they **are** being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped
but devices *are* there for the asking whether in stores or through the mail
nine states *have* introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring
and four states *california* florida michigan and pennsylvania *have* adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls *are* recorded
two bills in congress *hope* to make such restrictions national
but the only way you can find out how your people *are* doing *is* by listening
sometimes he *says* we 'll pull someone off the phones for more training
and in the past congress *has* viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations

ibm which *gets* about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes also announced upgraded operating system software that together with the new hardware *lets* customers do so-called batch processing as much as N N faster
prices on the larger models which *range* as high as $ N million generally wo n't change
analysts were disappointed that digital 's new line apparently wo n't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year which *begins* in july
large digital buyers *say* the new vax will let them stay with digital when they *need* the power of a mainframe instead of turning to ibm
i *'m* convinced there *'s* a huge market for this machine said stephen smith of painewebber inc
ibm 's mainframe sales **have** held up better than expected this year with analysts estimating they have risen N N to N N
we *have* a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without the systems that were announced yesterday
but the N line ***is*** nearly five years old which is getting up there in mainframe years and its growth is expected to slow in N
the fourth quarter *is* always *ibm* 's biggest by far with most sales coming in december as customers *seek* to use budgets before year end
ibm *has* already indicated it will have problems in the quarter partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of ibm 's overseas earnings when translated into dollars
some analysts *have* estimated ibm 's fourth-quarter per-share earnings will fall N N to $ N a share from $ N a share a year earlier

but now that congress **has** missed the legal deadline for meeting the gramm-rudman targets the white house said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill on which congress *continues* to work
if that *does* n't happen then we *press* forward on another vehicle and a separate vote said press secretary marlin fitzwater
on capitol hill though there *does* n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill

we *know* that saab *is* looking for a partner for industrial and financial cooperation fiat said
but that partner *is* n't fiat
fiat 's rejection of partnership with saab *means* that the swedish company which announced last friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted N N will *have* to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both ford motor corp. and fiat have turned down the offer
except for insurance however itt said it *expects* improved operating earnings in all of our businesses for the full year

though i *agree* with many of mr. kageyama 's comments i *believe* he *points* the gun in the wrong direction it *is* n't the americans who must be criticized for not understanding the japanese culture but the japanese who *insist* on forcing their culture on americans
the japanese *want* us to accept their culture but they *refuse* to accept the american culture
americans *are* expected to conform to the japanese culture when in japan
but the japanese *insist* upon japanese managers everywhere they *set* up shop
*do* the japanese feel so superior that they can not find capable american managers
japanese culture vs. american culture *is* irrelevant
then two weeks ago declaring that i *'m* not looking for any conflict over this the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest
i *do* not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life *is* threatened he proclaimed and finally vetoed the measure last weekend
so what *does* george bush really believe
anti-abortion forces *regard* him as at best an uncertain ally
yet abortion-rights forces *remain* bitterly critical
he *'s* totally geared to a punitive position
but ever since the supreme court 's webster vs. *reproductive* health services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue the president seemingly *has* tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall
if you *have* a position you *'re* better off to stick with it than to move around very much *says* republican strategist john sears
yet he *is* also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the white house
he acknowledged only one difference with mr. *reagan* that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life
now some *see* mr. bush trapped in a position he *is* neither comfortable with nor able to escape
th*is* is how american women won the right to vote
for the more than N million *americans* with disabilities the N americans with disabilities *act* *provides* the missing piece

goodyear tire & rubber *co.* buoyed by improved operating profit in its tire segment reported that third-quarter net income rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share
he said results were better than he 'd expected and *indicate* that goodyear *is* in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that *have* plagued the company for a year
goodyear 's stock which *has* been weak in recent weeks fell $ N yesterday to close at $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange
environmental control group inc. said it *expects* to report minimal earnings or a loss for the third quarter
as he handed over the reins to successor charles a. *corry* steel profits were close to a cyclical peak
in addition usx 's giant steel segment representing N N of its N sales *is* facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills
he was shocked associates *say* to learn of mr. icahn 's new takeover threat
now it *'s* mr. icahn 's move
mr. *icahn* may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in texaco inc. in june a coup that gave him enough cash to make his usx move
and although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets by making it harder to arrange takeover financing *has* eased some of the pressure on mr. *corry* it *does* n't end the takeover threat
in fact it *'s* barely begun for mr. corry who *faces* tough decisions before he *has* had a chance to get settled into his new job
i *do* n't think most of the people that *have* been around me would ever say they *'ve* seen me pound the table or get angry
and earlier this month he announced the sale of the reserves of texas oil & gas which was acquired three years ago and *has* n't posted any significant operating profits since
what *'s* more the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as texas oil & gas reported its first annual loss in N years
that would leave usx with marathon its steel mills and its diversified business segment which *includes* among other things mineral and transportation products
some *speculate* that mr. corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price
the problem **is** that mr. icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring usx than mr. corry had planned
mr. icahn *has* long believed associates *say* that the company whose N sales totaled $ N billion *is* worth $ N a share if broken up
mr. icahn *advocates* the sale of the company 's steel operations and mr. corry *does* n't necessarily disagree
in the past five years usx *has* turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs
it *is* n't surprising that messrs. roderick and corry *view* steel so differently
he *has* never met lynn williams the president of the united steelworkers union and *is* n't active in the industry 's main trade group the american iron and steel institute which *mr.* *roderick* served as chairman
dave thought the country needed a strong u.s. steel and while chuck agreed he was more apt to say not at any cost to shareholders a former executive *says*
indeed mr. corry at an august press conference talked about investing in steel as long as it *provides* a good return and not a day longer
the time *has* passed for us to spin off steel either in a public offering or to a buyer one executive *contends*
oil *has* long been mr. corry 's pet
however even usx executives who *work* closely with him *are* n't sure about his long-term goals
i *do* n't think he *has* a clear sense of where he *wants* the company to go one *says*
right now the executive *adds* he *wants* to continue to focus on paying down usx 's debt by selling assets
one thing *is* certain however *mr.* *corry* while studying other options probably wo n't make a major move until he *'s* clear about mr. icahn 's intentions
people got rich through takeovers in those days as they *do* today
u.s. officials however said they *are* n't buying the israeli argument

in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at N marks down from N marks monday and at N *yen* down from N yen late monday
in tokyo wednesday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N *yen* down from tuesday 's tokyo close of N yen
following the dive in u.s. stocks the mark *has* strengthened more than its major counterparts
but they *add* that the mark 's strength *is* in part a reflection of a shift away from u.s. assets by japanese investors into west german investments
the question *remains* how much can the west german market absorb *says* one senior dealer
despite the yen 's weakness with respect to the mark tokyo traders *say* they *do* n't expect the bank of japan to take any action to support the japanese currency on that front
boston co. 's fall from grace *is* bad news for its parent shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. which *has* relied heavily on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in recent years
shearson *does* n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries

as some securities *mature* and the proceeds *are* reinvested the problems ought to ease he said
sears roebuck & co. *is* struggling as it *enters* the critical christmas season
under the new approach *sears* set prices that were somewhere between its old regular and sale prices
sears officials *insist* they *do* n't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results
instead a spokesman *blames* the d*is*mal third-quarter showing on an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods which *account* for roughly two-thirds of sears 's annual merchandise volume
the new pricing strategy *is* working the spokesman asserted
sears **is** likely to be unsuccessful if it *continues* with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values
sears *is* also stepping up its television ads and changing its message
by lowering prices throughout its stores she *says* sears *has* the right idea
when sears *has* a sale at a special price the woman in the ad *declares* it *'s* something you *do* n't want to miss
recent surveys by leo j. shapiro & *associates* a market research firm in chicago *suggest* that sears *is* having a tough time attracting shoppers because it *has* n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise
you *see* some improvement in these other areas but it *'s* a very small and slow process
net income at sears 's merchandise group which *includes* international and credit card operations as well as u.s. stores fell N N
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday *sears* shares closed at $ N up N cents
in houston we *have* seen how bad the housing problem can become
at this stage some people just walk away from homes where the mortgage *exceeds* current market value

sales growth and profit in business products and systems xerox 's main business were disappointing said b. alex henderson who *follows* the company for prudential-bache securities inc
they *are* holding their own in a weak market and the restructuring *is* working he *says*
orders for military equipment household appliances machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped N N last month to $ N billion after leaping N N in *august* the department said
she added however it *is* not robust by any means
analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories *is* slipping
but analysts noted that excluding transportation where what they *believe* was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures order backlogs *have* declined for three months in a row
it *means* we *'re* eating into the bread that *keeps* us going
but a commerce department analyst said that in both months orders would have r*is*en had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year
now at least there *are* question marks about that and without any question the pace of growth *has* slowed
the norfolk va. company *has* N million shares outstanding
a spokeswoman said the company will finance the buy-back with cash on hand borrowing and cash norfolk *expects* to generate
still analysts *do* n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term
that *is* in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding she said
the buy-back **is** really a comfort to those who *want* to buy the stock that there is a price floor he said
at a certain price if the management *thinks* the stock *is* cheap they can go in and buy it
it *has* purchased about N million of them

now this remarkable economic growth *seems* to be coming to an end because the government *has* not converted itself into a modern democratic developed nation mode of operation
that system *has* worked
the standard of living *has* increased steadily over the past N years more than N N of the people *consider* themselves middle class
the symptoms all point to one thing japan *does* not have a modern government
in a modern system the government 's role *is* to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they *are* capable of making a choice
it also *allows* people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world
the japanese government *does* n't allow this
the min*is*try of health and welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people
the ministry of transportation *serves* the industry certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices
all this *illustrates* that japanese ministries still *have* a provider mentality they *do* not serve the people and particularly not consumers
they *serve* the industries and the special-interest groups
japan *is* not a political country
it *is* a bureaucratic country
the diet *plays* a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system
most bills *are* drafted by bureaucrats not politicians
the diet **does** n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties *are* so often opposed to whatever ldp does that it would be a waste of time
so most bills **are** passed without full discussion particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties
a recent example *is* the N N consumption tax on all commercial activities
th*is* *makes* enormous sense in japan where direct tax accounts for more than N N of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair
if you *are* a retailer N N and a farmer N N
it *'s* now ok to deal with the u.s. but not the soviet union

how *do* readers feel about the magazine

but some analysts *say* salomon *has* turned the corner
the market *has* been overly harsh to them
with the market overbuilt builders *are* finding limited opportunities and increased risks
developers and money managers *are* looking for bargains among the thousands of financially troubled properties around the country
there *are* n't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as N years ago *says* charles *shaw* a chicago-based real estate developer
developers *are* also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that can finance big projects
the builders *are* more willing to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees to stay afloat in the soft market
and to succeed in the turnaround business he *says* developers may have to put in a lot of money and time

the firms *have* all said that west virginia 's suit *is* without merit
that suit *is* pending
as we will see many of these obligations *do* n't show up as part of the federal deficit
but recent events *indicate* that federal credit *is* out of control
scores of other credit programs subsidizing agriculture small business exporters defense energy transportation and others *are* less visible but in no better shape
if the programs *continue* their present path the potential government losses *are* staggering the federal government *holds* $ N billion in direct loans outstanding and *backs* an additional $ N billion in primary guarantees
there *is* a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program
to avoid this problem government should issue credit only if it *intends* to use every legal method to collect
however this in no way *justifies* the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans
credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that *provide* the subsidy
the program *provides* highly subsidized loans to any student whose family *earns* less than a particular amount
high default rates a low interest rate and government coverage of all interest costs while the student *is* in school *make* program costs extremely high
families that *do* not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates
N *provide* better incentives
given the structure of most credit programs it *is* surprising that default rates *are* not even higher
guarantee rates *are* typically N N giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully
reducing those rates moderately *say* to N N would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers
for example the small business administration *has* had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its preferred lenders ' program
in addition it *is* often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts *are* not paid off
since the budget *measures* cash flow a new $ N direct loan *is* treated as a $ N expenditure even though at least part of the loan will be paid back
predictably guarantees outstanding **have** risen by $ N billion since N while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ N billion
the true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy *is* the discounted value of the net costs to government
a budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what congress *is* committing them to
in any case they *avoid* having to write off the loans
president bush *is* considering casting a line-item veto as a test to determine whether the courts will rule that he *has* such authority
he *has* argued that such presidential power *is* necessary to rein in congressional spending
white house spokesman *marlin* fitzwater confirming comments made th*is* week by vice president dan quayle said mr. bush is interested in finding a suitable test case
for instance the new u.s. package *makes* clear there would be a transition period during which gatt members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition
it also *says* countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they *experience* an unusually heavy volume of imports
the u.s. *contends* that the rules *are* n't justified on health grounds
to encourage more competition among exporting countries the u.s. *is* proposing that export subsidies including tax incentives for exporters be phased out in five years

in the 1980s the justice department and lower federal courts that *enforce* the voting rights act *have* required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of safe minority election districts districts where minorities *form* between N N and N N of the voting population
the program *has* even been called upon to create safe white electoral districts in municipalities where whites *are* the minority
one essential indicator that they *are* *is* that members of minority groups *get* elected to public office with reasonable frequency
as *is* blacks *constitute* N N of the population but fewer than N N of elected leaders
but racial gerrymandering *is* not the best way to accomplish that essential goal
it *is* a quick fix for a complex problem
such a policy *implies* that only a black politician can speak for a black person and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one
racial gerrymandering *has* been a familiar policy in new york city since N when congress first amended the voting rights act to expand its reach beyond the southern states
blacks and hispanics currently *make* up N N of the city 's population and hold only N N of the seats on the council
to win their seats on the council these political leaders *have* had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all
often they *have* found that the relevant *is*sue is not race but rather housing crime prevention or education
in birmingham which *is* N N black whites *are* the minority
now you *go* to districts you *'re* likely to get candidates whose views *are* more extreme white and black on racial issues
racial gerrymandering creating separate black and white districts *says* that we *have* discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people

but the appropriations set in motion spending that *adds* to an already grim budget picture for fiscal N
the underlying bill approved yesterday *is* required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight and this urgency *has* contributed to the speed and critics *say* mistakes that *have* accompanied the package of disaster assistance
and the state 's delegation *is* fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ N million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year

the stake was acquired by a group of N japanese financial institutions and industrial corporations primarily insurance companies *honeywell* said

the market however *is* expected to remain stable and expectations for future gains *are* high traders said
such sentiment **is** being supported by word that a large amount of cash from investment trust funds is scheduled to enter the market later this week and in early november
the expected amount *is* said to be N billion yen $ N billion to N trillion yen the second largest amount this year in a given period following the record high set at the end of july according to market observers
in addition to a large amount of investment trust fund cash analysts generally *see* the market environment improving compared with the past couple of weeks
investors *expect* these shares will be targets of investment trust funds which often *buy* small amounts spread across a wide range of issues
on the other hand high-priced sh*are*s such as pioneer electronic and sony failed to spark investor interest because these issues are unlikely to be bought by investment trust funds observers said

but when blacks *are* getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites and in some cities it **is** three and four times as often i *conclude* that discrimination is part of the problem
the legislation also *requires* broad new disclosures of the race sex and income level of borrowers but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least
for instance he noted the fed studies *have* shown that blacks *receive* more home improvement loans than whites
several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they *have* been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination
time *is* also fighting the transaction on other fronts by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining tele-communications as investors in showtime cable-tv industry executives *say*

the downturn also *raises* questions about the carriers ' ambitious orders for new airplanes which currently *total* $ N billion over the next three years
for travelers though the industry 's problems *have* had some positive effects
in recent weeks airlines *have* cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers
the industry 's slowdown became apparent this month when amr *corp.* parent of american airlines reported an N N drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be disappointing
in announcing the results usair cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials *have* named recently
it said the industry 's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter analysts *say* this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer
but so far the effort *has* failed and traffic *is* still slow
this summer the industry introduced a kids *fly* free program in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult
rising operating expenses *are* another problem

but partner richard nye said th*is* is the most extraordinary failed transaction i *'ve* seen in N years in this business
any investor who *acquires* ual stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with united 's contentious unions
the pilots *are* working under an expired contract and the machinists contract *expires* next month
that *gives* them enormous leverage including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they *oppose*
another trader noted that many arbitrage firms *are* afraid to sell their ual stock at the bottom but already own so much they ca n't buy any more
they *check* in but they ca n't check out
but both the traders and the pilots *remain* interested in some transaction
so too according to many reports *is* british airways *plc* despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out
it *is* unclear however if the machinists would support a majority stake as the pilots *want*

she noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product **is** due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about N N to N N

sci tv 's grace period for paying its bills *is* due to expire nov. N
it now *is* quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt
but it *'s* understood that mr. krav*is* is disappointed that mr. gillett did n't manage to boost sci tv 's operating profit after the buy-out
mr. kravis apparently *thinks* sci tv can survive if lenders *extend* its debt payments until tv stations *rise* in value again allowing sci tv to sell assets to pay debt
mr. gillett *is* said to be proud of his operating record he *has* lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a detroit station

but others *say* junk-holders *have* nothing to gain by putting sci tv into bankruptcy-law proceedings
while kkr *does* n't control sci tv which *is* unusual for a kkr investment it clearly *has* much deeper pockets than mr. gillett
by contrast kkr probably *has* already made all the money it can on sci tv

forecasting *is* only one part of litigation sciences ' work
changing the outcome of the trial *is* what really matters
since litigation sciences generally *represents* the defense its job *is* usually to help the lawyers *identify* and remove such people from the jury
for personal-injury cases litigation sciences *seeks* defense jurors who *believe* that most people including victims *get* what they *deserve*
the consultants *help* the defense lawyers *find* such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work or toward particular movies or books
as mr. vinson *explains* it we *do* n't control the facts
they **are** what they are
logic *plays* a minimal role here
in a classic defense of a personal-injury case the consultants *concentrate* on encouraging the jury to shift the blame
the ideal defense in a case involving an accident *is* to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight mr. vinson *has* written
lawyers *remain* divided about whether anything *is* wrong with all this

peter teagan a special*is*t in heat transfer is running a project at arthur d. little inc. of cambridge mass. to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate cfcs
i would be the first to admit that there *is* not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems *says* mr. teagan
but the nature of the problem **is** such that many others *feel* it *has* to be addressed soon before all the evidence is in
but *does* it have to be so soon
some atmospheric scientists *think* that even if cfcs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate the amount of ozone depletion would be only N N by the middle of the next century
moreover there *are* questions particularly among atmospheric scient*is*ts who *know* this subject best about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer
the ozone layer *is* constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure
mr. teagan *points* out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without cfcs *is* less efficient than current devices energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect
as it *happens* arthur d. little *is* not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories
it *is* interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without cfcs
there *is* after all big money in environmentalism
du pont as it *happens* *has* a potential substitute for cfcs
imperial chemical industries of the u.k. also *has* one and *is* building a plant in louisiana to produce it
there *are* still others who *do* n't mind seeing new crises *arise*
in other words environmentalism *has* created a whole set of vested interests that *f**are*** better when there are many problems than when there are few

instead h*is* merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon cd which is sold at a deep discount to its face value
the difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity *is* the investor 's return
now the thrift that **is**sued the cd is insolvent and dr. blumenfeld *has* learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance
th*is* is one thing i was never aware of he *says*
he assumed that principal and interest were fully insured up to $ N he *adds*
dr. blumenfeld *is* n't unique
the biggest problem we *have* *is* that investors *realize* after the fact that they did n't understand what they were investing in
but he *says* he did n't understand he was buying the cd on the secondary market and he *contends* his broker never fully explained the risks
those officials *say* there was full disclosure of the risks in a fact sheet sent to all cd investors with their confirmation of sale
i assumed i was buying a cd as a cd he *says*
there *'s* a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware of the risks
merrill lynch **says** it *'s* impossible to estimate how many investors *are* in dr. blumenfeld 's situation although it says the firm *has* received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years
merrill lynch now *provides* credit rating information about the institutions whose cds it *sells* which it did n't provide in N
merrill lynch *estimates* that fewer than N financial institutions currently *issue* zero-coupon cds
still there *are* several billion dollars of zero-coupon cds with various maturities outstanding
most zero-coupon cds *are* in maturities of six to nine years and they usually *double* in value by maturity
but investors who bought zero-coupon cds in the secondary market *are* n't the only ones who may be surpr*is*ed to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured
people who paid a premium for standard cds purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums *are* n't insured if the institutions that issued the cds failed
however those premiums *are* usually far smaller than on zero-coupon cds and the simpler pricing structure of a standard cd *makes* it more apparent when a premium *is* paid
dr. blumenfeld *says* he *'s* satisfied that his problem *has* been resolved
and he *says* he *'s* learned a lesson you always *have* to watch out for yourself

our teachers *are* not an important factor in our educational crisis
it *is* silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more
it *is* the kind of libel the teachers ' unions *do* n't mind spreading for their own narrow purposes
it *is* also the kind of libel politicians *find* useful since it *helps* them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency

the reason **is** simple education *takes* place in the classroom where the influence of money is minimal
that *is* the way the system *works*
the purpose of education *is* to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential
no one in his right mind actually *believes* that we all *have* an equal academic potential

he said he *expects* ibm to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months

there *has* indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since N
but i had expected more which *is* one reason i began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates
it *is* however possible that further study will reveal increasing bias
th*is* *means* that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor
in an unrelated program in which the labor department *does* estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of N N during the 1980s
independent estimates of output in those industries including one by the department of labor for banking *suggests* that productivity in finance and services *appears* to have risen by an average of at least N N a year between N and N
since then further research *argues* that failure to take account of quality improvements *has* contributed a total of at least N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate

but individuals familiar with the generally successful drexel talks *say* the firm *is* meeting resistance from some big states including new jersey new york california pennsylvania connecticut and missouri
officials in some of these states *say* they *do* n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by drexel
drexel *has* to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the securities and exchange commission that *includes* payment of $ N million in penalties
but they *disagree* about the message these settlements *give* to the public
the question she said **is** whether drexel should be allowed to pay and move on or whether you should simply revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony
while ms. bryant 's state went ahead and accepted drexel 's settlement offer of $ N she said i *do* n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions
still i *understand* the reasons that other states *are* holding out he said
mr. *cohen* the drexel general counsel said i *do* n't think as we *say* in investment banking that by the end of the day we 'll be losing any licenses
asked about states that ***are*** taking a hard line he said there are states that *have* asked for additional information which we are providing to them
mr. cohen said more than $ N million *has* been paid to N states and that drexel still *expects* to pay out a total of $ N million
the rate we **'re** going i *think* that by the end of the month we 're looking to have a total of N to N he said
the investment bank *has* previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry
there **are** according to several securities commissioners at least N states that are either close to settlements with drexel or who *do* n't appear opposed to settling
drexel 's proposed state fines *have* been based on a state 's population and on the size of drexel 's business in the state
connecticut already *has* issued a notice of intent to revoke drexel 's brokerage license
it *is* one of the states that *have* met with mr. cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters
a banking department spokesman added comm*is*sioner brown *does* n't feel that money alone is the issue here
particularly touchy *are* the cases of new york which *is* drexel 's base and california the base of drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties
neither state *has* settled and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so
still she said drexel 's trouble with some states *is* n't a bad thing
this process should point out that it **'s** not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business ms. bryant said
we *need* to have somebody worried so they *do* n't do this again

at the same time it *has* been caught in an earnings squeeze
the california pension fund 's planned investment in the real estate unit *is* unusual
pension funds rarely *own* as much as a N N stake in what *is* expected to be a publicly traded company
in addition pension funds *are* rarely given seats on company boards and most often *try* to avoid them because of legal concerns
but fund officials said the santa fe pacific realty investment *provides* an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with california properties
it also *marks* a major commitment to real estate development which we *have* n't been involved with before said dale hanson the fund 's executive director
it was n't clear where santa fe pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ N million which would be well above the $ N million that california pension fund officials *say* they *plan* to provide
santa fe pacific realty *owns* N million acres of property including N buildings with more than N million square feet of space
it also *holds* nearly N acres of raw land with development potential but under a previously announced strategy the company *has* targeted building on N acres in california arizona and the chicago area

the dispute *pits* two groups of claimants against each other
the bankruptcy-court reorganization *is* being challenged before the supreme court by a dissident group of claimants because it *places* a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims
it also *bars* future suits against *robins* company officials members of the robins family and robins 's former insurer aetna life & casualty co
the latter prov**is**ion is legally unprecedented said alan b. morrison a public interest lawyer in washington d.c. who is challenging the plan on behalf of N claimants
more than N claims against robins *are* pending
robins *has* been in proceedings under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code since august N such proceedings *give* it protection from creditor lawsuits while it *works* out a plan for paying its debts
american home products corp. *wants* to acquire robins but only if all legal challenges to the plan *are* exhausted
the supreme court *is* scheduled to consider the case nov. N and may issue a decision as early as nov. N

the dinner was a stark confirmation that N *is* the worst year ever for the $ N billion junk market
and investors and traders alike *say* the current turmoil could take years to resolve
in an interview mr. joseph *says* his dinner discussion with the prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk
unlike the new york stock exchange where buyers and sellers **are** quickly matched the junk market where r*is*ky corporate loans are traded is sometimes closed for repairs
in recent months they *say* there *has* been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors while new buyers *have* n't materialized to replace them
meanwhile prudential the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds *has* seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $ N billion from $ N billion since august because of falling junk prices
but we *think* the risks *are* there for things getting a lot worse
and the risks *are* n't appropriate for us he *says*
the big insurer unlike prudential *owns* only about $ N million of publicly sold junk bonds
obviously we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky *says* bradford cornell professor of finance at university of california 's anderson graduate school of management in los angeles
mr. cornell *has* just completed a study that *finds* that the risks and returns of junk bonds *are* less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds
despite the junk market 's problems *drexel* *continues* to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its wall street rivals *have* n't found
during the past three weeks for example drexel *has* sold $ N billion of new junk bonds for turner broadcasting co. uniroyal chemical continental air and duff & phelps
but the deals that never should *have* been brought have now become nuclear waste
but name-dropping *has* other benefits often *civic*
it *helps* to point out how many important people came through cleveland on their way to the top *says* george miller executive director of the new cleveland campaign a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths
power names like that *do* n't hurt the city 's reputation mr. miller *says*
it *is* john hart
he *admits* he *has* no story on any of them on these occasions
she *prefers* elizabeth

the winners he *predicts* will be brands from car makers that *have* traditionally been associated with quality and value
he *says* it *'s* important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image
she *wants* something big and already *has* looked at the chrysler new yorker and lincoln town car
today they *identify* N distinct segments for cars and another N for trucks and vans
when consumers *have* so many choices brand loyalty *is* much harder to maintain
the wall street journal 's american way of buying survey found that N N of today 's car buyers *tend* to switch brands
which cars *do* americans *favor* most these days
young consumers *prefer* luxury cars by a N N to N N margin even though older buyers because of their incomes *are* more likely to actually purchase a luxury car
perhaps most striking N N of households headed by people aged N to N *have* at least one foreign car
that *'s* true of only N N of households headed by someone N or older
some N N *give* foreign cars higher quality ratings down from N N two years ago
on the other hand only N N *say* foreign cars *are* less comfortable than u.s. models down from N N in N
people in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger americans *are* to brand switching
manufacturers too *are* stretching further to lure buyers
but even a little appeal *has* a lot of attraction these days
but for those californians who *want* exotic gardens out front where neighbors can appreciate them there *'s* always harold smith 's approach
september program trading amounted to N N of average daily new york stock exchange volume of N million shares the largest percentage since the exchange began making such figures *public* in july N
the big board *says* program trading *describes* a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of N or more stocks
the most controversial of these *is* stock-index arbitrage in which traders *buy* or *sell* baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits
it *'s* the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market
salomon brothers *inc.* was the top program trader in september but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading *strategies* other than stock-index arbitrage
the suit *seeks* unspecified damages
imperial *is* in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities
the derivative suit *is* similar to a class-action complaint filed earlier this year
imperial said in a statement it *expects* other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems
the companies *are* followed by at least three analysts and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share
estimated and actual results involving losses *are* omitted
the percent difference *compares* actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts *have* issues forecasts in the past N days

japanese electronic giants such as sony corp. and hitachi ltd. *have* focused almost entirely on hdtv hardware and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition

indeed the stakes *are* high
the u.s. electronics industry *estimates* that the hdtv market will total about $ N billion over the next two decades with an additional $ N billion expected to go for related products
but the financial rewards **are** n't expected soon nor are they guaranteed

recently the industry *has* faced the threat of new restrictions and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe
and because the pachinko industry *is* regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion some observers *estimate* the real income could be as much as N trillion yen
but the press kept it alive as with the recruit scandal *lists* began circulating with names of people who had received money
no one *has* alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal
direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups *are* defined as foreign but both groups *deny* making direct donations
they **s*ay* it s possible some of their members may be donating privately
the *is*sue is further complicated because although the organizations *represent* korean residents those residents were largely born and raised in japan and many *speak* only japanese
both residents ' organizations *admit* to receiving some funding from abroad

and the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income personal income after taxes *has* hit a high of about N N N
however these figures *do* n't seem to worry thomas a. durkin an economist at the federal reserve board
mr. durkin *doubts* that there *is* some magic level at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income *indicates* economic problems
the chart below shows why *see* accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N
moreover the burden of consumer credit payments *relative* to disposable income may be lower in this cycle than earlier mr. durkin *says*
he *notes* that some revolving credit-card credit *is* actually convenience credit being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing
the most frequent use *is* home improvement which presumably *improves* the value of the property mr. durkin *says*
consumers *appear* unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending bruce steinberg a merrill lynch economist *says*

such attitudes *have* given federal flexibility not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean
ups wo n't discuss its labor practices but according to mr. cleveland a former ups employee and others union work rules *prohibit* ups drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans

although the tiger acquisition **has** brought federal a long way toward becoming the global player it *wants* to be it also has brought problems
in europe business suffered as federal bought several local companies only to have the managers *quit*
earnings *have* plummeted too in each of the past three quarters
in the fiscal first period ended aug. N profit fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share mostly because of the tiger merger federal *says*
since trading as low as $ N a share in may federal 's shares *have* rallied as high as $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading
there *'s* a certain irony in the fact that federal express *faces* its first union problems as a result of its tiger purchase
federal express officials *acknowledge* mistakes in their drive overseas but *say* it will pay off eventually
he then made most of the changes pilots *say*
that sort of approach however *has* n't worked since the addition of tiger
mr. smith and other top federal executives *have* met with tiger workers in los angeles *ohio* new york alaska asia and europe
he said mr. steinberg had insisted that the merger talks *move* quickly
furthermore mr. smith added our contract with our pilots *says* that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice
it *does* n't give any particular group the ability to veto change
already the fight *has* been costly
the issue *has* also cost federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots
but though most of the N federal pilots *are* believed opposed it *is* unclear just how much their loyalty to mr. smith *has* been eroded
and for now at least the competition *is* n't the only enemy

that *'s* not plot

however the panama ep*is*ode *has* raised questions about whether the nsc staff is sufficiently big diverse and powerful to coordinate u.s. policy on tough issues
during the coup attempt and its aftermath nsc staffers were stretched very thin *says* one senior administration official
it *'s* a very small shop
gen. scowcroft *does* n't plan to increase the staff right now but *is* weighing that possibility the official *adds*
the problem with th*is* administration i *think* is that by design it *has* greatly diminished both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense the role of the nsc
by law the council *includes* the president vice president and secretaries of state and defense
but the size shape and role of the nsc staff *have* been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide
in the bush white house the size of the nsc 's staff of professional officers *is* down to about N from about N in N administration officials *say*
administration officials *insist* that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the panama crisis
both gen. scowcroft and his deputy robert gates *are* experts in u.s.-soviet affairs
but neither *has* an extensive background in latin america the middle east or asia
in those areas the role of nsc staffers under them therefore *have* become more important

saab said last week it *has* had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers

mr. jones *takes* heart
once fat and happy the cowboys now *are* losing games fans and money
it *has* some of the highest costs in the league
its attendance *is* off N N from six years ago
one team *pays* so much and the other pays more
we just *do* n't have that kind of income stream
though not intentionally the cowboys ' mr. jones *has* come to represent this new breed of owner
i *'m* at extension N
it *'s* just not cost efficient he *says*
the place *costs* nearly $ N million a year to maintain
after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years the cowboys needed a change he *says*
football *has* long been mr. jones 's passion both on and off the field
seven games and after a loss to the kansas city chiefs yesterday seven losses into the season the new cowboys *are* n't doing any better than the old
average attendance at their games about N last year *continues* flat
mr. jones *is* attacking the problem on several fronts
but the general trend given r*is*ing costs in the league *has* been to raise prices and mr. jones is expected to eventually follow suit
the sales job *seems* to be paying off when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold
today N *have*
gate receipts *are* only the cowboys ' second largest source of cash
the biggest *is* the nfl 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games
the team additionally *earns* between $ N million and $ N million for local radio and television broadcast rights
mr. jones *is* currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights
he *is* also trying to get more stations in mexico where the cowboys *have* a following to pick up the games
he *calls* the contracts critical to winning in the nfl and *has* played his part in the bidding wars
th*is* wage inflation is bleeding the nfl *dry* the owners *contend*
the owners *are* trying to boost profit in other ways too
most of the owners must pay up to N N of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they *say* *are* either too small or too old
in chicago for example size *is* the issue
when the lease *expires* in N he *says* it *'s* got to be changed
and the league *is* trying to get more for its three-year national network contract which *expires* after this season
the current contract *pays* the nfl $ N billion
owners *say* they *expect* the league to demand a N N increase despite the fact that televised football games *have* had lackluster ratings
an nfl spokesman also *says* the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like espn
the changes *have* n't come easy
like the game of professional football the nfl organization itself *is* in turmoil
the owners *meet* again tomorrow
for his part jerry jones *says* he *'s* in the business for the long haul and his work style *seems* to support that
when i made this investment i made it on a lifetime basis he *explains*
wh*i*le the cowboys may not be the best investment now i *do* n't accept they ca n't be in the future
besides to a large extent mr. jones may already be getting what he *wants* out of the team even though it *keeps* losing
one example he *gives* she did n't ask why the palestinian children *are* soldiers throwing stones
mr. goldberg *contends* that even as propaganda the film *fails* because it *presents* only one view

president bush *wants* the pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week
if the request *is* approved by both the house and senate mr. cheney would need only permission from the white house office of management and budget to move the money according to senate budget analysts
that would give the pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency *has*
that **is** n't consistent with the kind of discipline that gramm-rudman is supposed to impose he said
under the deficit-reduction law N N of the pentagon 's money and N N of other agencies ' money *has* been canceled

but some wall street executives *argue* that such fears *are* unwarranted
in a july N letter to the senate securities subcommittee first *boston* corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the N market crash *demonstrates* that current rules *are* adequate
first boston whose holding company cs first boston group **is** one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on wall street said it is also concerned that once the sec *has* the power to monitor holding companies it will try to regulate their activities
there *is* a simple reason for this the cuban people

a spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond *is*sue but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks before the november mayoral election
general obligation bonds *are* backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit
the fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that new york 's budgetary problems *are* more serious than had been expected
there *have* been reports for months that the city 's economy *is* weakening as the october N stock market crash *continues* to make itself felt
meanwhile tax revenues **are** falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding
in a study the comptroller said the city 's glory days *are* over
new york city 's rev*is*ed financial plan due out later this month is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ N billion budget
at present analysts **project** a budget gap on the order of $ N million to $ N million for the fiscal year ending june N N although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit
mark page new york 's deputy director of finance said that investors ' concerns about the city 's financial health *are* unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves
and the controversy *has* led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election
now there *have* been a number of questions raised
earlier this month qintex australia 's $ N billion agreement to acquire mgm\/ua communications *co.* collapsed because of a dispute over a $ N million letter of credit the australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction
qintex entertainment *is* N N owned by qintex australia and said it *relies* on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements
the qintex *australia* spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter N filing
it *'s* understood that mgm\/ua recently contacted rupert murdoch 's news corp. which made two failed bids for the movie studio to see if the company was still interested
however we *are* n't currently doing anything
the ministry *has* never even suggested that japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general mr. utsumi said
the comments were the min*is*try 's first detailed public statement on the subject and *reflect* the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets
in general mr. utsumi said japanese banks *are* becoming more independent in their approach to overseas deals
each japanese bank *has* its own judgment on the profits and risks in that ual deal he said
they *are* becoming more independent
it *'s* a sound phenomenon
all week there *has* been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position
bank analysts *say* ministry officials *have* been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads
the ministry *thinks* the banks *do* n't know what they *are* doing that they *have* very little idea how to cope with risk said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified
japanese banks *are* under political pressure as well the analyst said
moreover analysts *point* out that japanese banks *have* a reputation for doing deals that *are* n't extremely profitable if they *offer* the chance to build market share cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats
clearly some financial authorities *are* concerned about the japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs
while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever japanese banks *are* n't likely to walk away from the game
despite the risks the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market bank analysts *say*
flush with cash at home but with fewer customers to lend to leading banks *are* eager to expand overseas

what *gives* these events particular significance however *is* the fact that they *are* part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the u.s. and the soviet union on the horn of africa
mr. barre 's rule *is* crumbling fast
inflation *is* at record levels
think what these numbers *mean* considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in lebanon a small country of little strategic importance
the weaker he *gets* the more he *turns* toward the u.s. for help
what *'s* more the u.s. *has* suspended $ N million in military aid and $ N million in economic aid
but th*is* is not enough
because the u.s. *is* still perceived to be tied to mr. barre when he *goes* the runway could go too
the u.s. should take care however that its own position in the country *does* not go down with him
nobody *is* sure what will come next in somalia or whom the successor might be
but as one expert *tells* me whoever it *is* will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than barre
it *'s* not just in eastern europe where the march of events *is* finally on the u.s. side but on the horn of africa as well
the only u.s. liability in the region *is* what *remains* of the link to mr. barre and that should be cut fast
*canada* 's consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted N N in september from august statistics canada a federal agency said
opec 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell *is* beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets
output from the organization of petroleum exporting countries *is* already at a high for the year and most member nations *are* running flat out
the organization *is* scheduled to meet in vienna beginning nov. N
so far this year rising demand for opec oil and production restraint by some members *have* kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others
at that rate a majority of opec 's N members *have* reached their output limits they said
but it *is* estimated that at least three million barrels a day and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day of spare capacity still *exists* within opec
he *puts* opec 's current capacity at N million to N million barrels a day
that *'s* higher than some other estimates
however in interviews later both ministers stressed that they *expect* future opec quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member
but the oil ministers *continue* to study the plan and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting
though tiny that *'s* a reduction in its share
the air force *is* to take at least N more

for cathay pacific *airways* the smooth ride may be ending
and tough competition in the air-freight market *is* cutting into an important sideline
the sense *is* we would never be in a position again where everything *works* for us the way it did before *says* rod eddington cathay 's commercial director
these factors *are* further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one ms. hall *says*
ms. hall *expects* cathay 's profit to grow around N N annually this year and next
cathay *is* taking several steps to bolster business
one step *is* to beef up its fleet
some jobs already *have* been moved to australia and there *are* plans to place others in canada
although the june N killings in beijing **have** hurt its china flights *cathay* 's other routes have retained high load factors
there also *has* been speculation that cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the hong kong government 's plans to build a new airport with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal
cathay officials *decline* to comment on the speculation
mr. eddington *sees* alliances with other carriers particularly *cathay* 's recent link with amr corp. 's american airlines as an important part of cathay 's strategy
analysts *believe* cathay *is* approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis particularly as the popularity of share exchanges *has* grown among european carriers
we *think* alliances *are* very important mr. *eddington* *says*
we 'll never have a big operation in the u.s. and they 'll never have one as big as us in the pacific mr. eddington *says*
asian traffic which currently *accounts* for N N of cathay 's business *is* expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay
further expansion into southern europe *is* also possible *says* mr. *bell* the spokesman
my feeling *is* cathay *does* n't have a hope in the long run *says* an analyst who *declines* to be identified
cathay would love to keep going but the general sense *is* they *'re* going to have to do something

against such a backdrop companies with proven track records of earnings gains of N N or so annually *have* extra appeal
the market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth declares *mary* farrell a painewebber analyst
like many otc growth issues they *have* market values as measured by stock price times shares outstanding of roughly $ N million to $ N million
some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares *have* n't traded publicly very long
the main argument for growth stocks *is* their usually superior performance in a slowing economy

in anticipation of that shift he and other analysts *are* encouraging their clients to buy such issues now

its return so far this year *has* been a credible N N

the collapse of a $ N billion buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. *has* handed wall street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal
in the meantime the question faced by investors **is** what is ual stock worth
the short answer on a fundamental bas**is** is that airline analysts *say* the stock is worth somewhere between $ N and $ N a share
that *'s* based on a multiple of anywhere between N to N times ual earnings which *are* estimated to come in somewhere around $ N a share this year
airline stocks typically *sell* at a d*is*count of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio which is currently about N times earnings
that analysis *matches* up with stock traders ' reports that despite the huge drop in the stock ual *has* n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings
one analyst who asked not to be identified said he *believes* that the ual pilots and management can put together a bid in the $ N area but that it could take three to four months to close
at that level and given the uncertainty he *believes* ual stock should trade closer to
other observers *note* that ual 's board having accepted a bid of $ N a share might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level even if it *means* that the management *goes* back to running the company for a while and *lets* things return to normal
by that *logic* the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months even though the eventual price might be higher
investment bankers following ual agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal *is* that the pilots *have* been attempting a buy-out for more than two years and *are* n't likely to stop having come so close to success
the pilots *have* a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ N million and to commit $ N million from their retirement funds
banks *want* to see someone putting up real cash at r*is*k that is subordinate to the bank debt in any deal
that *leaves* the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ N billion far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone
one obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash *is* their insistence on majority ownership
investors such as marvin davis of los angeles who **have** sought airline ownership this year have insisted they not the pilots must have control
the pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they *have* been seeking
but it *is* n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders
using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios first boston estimated ual 's value at $ N to $ N a share if its future labor costs *conform* to wall street projections $ N to $ N if the company *reaches* a settlement with pilots similar to one at nwa $ N to $ N under an adverse labor settlement and $ N to $ N under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike
and using liquidation value assuming the sale of all ual assets first boston estimated the airline *is* worth $ N to $ N a share
american airlines parent amr and usair group both *subject* to takeover efforts themselves *have* each warned of declining results
some analysts *do* n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots
the deal *has* as one takeover expert *puts* it so many moving parts
i *do* n't see anybody who *'s* sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving
in addition to the need for another cash equity investor the other moving parts *include* the pilots themselves who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike the machinists union the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal and regulators in washington whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt
wall street traders and analysts *estimate* that takeover stock traders own ual stock and options *equal* to as many as N million shares or about N N of the total outstanding
but the customer *does* n't want that

bankers *say* however that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price
the bank *has* a negative net worth they *say*
his ability to match any bid *has* scared off many potential buyers
separately the government will try again within a month to sell the N N stake in paper industries corp. of the philippines or picop as the paper mill *is* known
the price will depend on how much picop shares *fetch* on the local stock market
but according to bankers and stock analysts who *have* studied the paper mill price *is* n't the only consideration
as it *stands* now the government would continue to hold N N of picop after the N N stake *is* sold
about N N of picop *is* publicly traded and other shareholders *own* the rest of the equity
mr. garcia *acknowledges* the problem and *says* the asset trust will study why the bidding failed and what *changes* the agency may be able to offer
under government regulations however foreign ownership of picop 's equity *is* limited to N N
even though the government would retain the N N stake in picop critics *have* accused the trust of selling out to foreigners

but the enterprises still in state hands *include* the biggest and most economically powerful ones in mexico indeed they virtually *constitute* the economic infrastructure

those enterprises however *are* not going to be privatized
they *are* officially considered strategic and their privatization *is* prohibited by the mexican constitution

a labor-management group *is* preparing a revised buy-out bid for united airlines parent ual corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands according to people familiar with the group
the group *has* been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ N to $ N a share or $ N billion to $ N billion
but to avoid the risk of rejection the group *does* n't plan to submit the plan formally at a ual board meeting today
people familiar with the company *say* the board *is* n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share $ N billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner british airways *plc* dropped out
but the pilots union which **has** been pushing for a takeover since N *appears* to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace british air
although the bidding group *has* n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks it *believes* bank financing could be obtained
ual currently *has* N million shares fully diluted
the new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders *get* a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest
the difference *is* that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control
although the pilots *are* expected to continue to pursue the bid ual chairman stephen wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time
the board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one-third of ual stock *is* held by takeover stock speculators who *favor* a sale
the labor-management buy-out group *plans* to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board
however the only outsider who *has* emerged to lead such a shareholder vote los angeles investor marvin dav*is* who triggered the buy-out with a $ N billion bid in early august is hanging back apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse
but citicorp *has* lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group
on friday british air issued a statement saying it *does* not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of ual in the foreseeable future
one advantage the buy-out group *intends* to press with the board *is* that pilots *have* agreed to make $ N million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid
it noted however that it *has* n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction

in east germany where humor *has* long been the only way to express political criticism they *'re* not laughing about their new leader egon krenz
with krenz we just *do* n't know what to expect
but he *does* n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either
on thursday a day after he took office east german television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers *call* in questions for a panel of officials to answer
other changes including easing restrictions on travel for east germans *are* expected
but whether such moves can win back the confidence of east germans who *have* taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes *depends* largely on whether they *feel* they can trust mr. krenz
and that *'s* a problem
the most important thing *is* that he have a chance
people *have* a sense the government *is* ignoring the real problems in our society
he **'s** a very tough man but one who 's also open to arguments *adds* an aide to west german chancellor helmut kohl
but there *'s* another side to mr. krenz
even if he *is* she *adds* he *appears* to have only limited room for maneuver within the communist party 's ruling politburo
but if he *'s* sharp and quick he *has* a chance

silver 's h*is*tory of volatility is also discouraging investors dealers *say*
although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar precious metals *are* out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation dealers *say*
silver however *is* in a deeper slump than *are* gold and platinum
a further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the u.s. he *says*
scrap merchants **are** converting smaller quantities of metal into silver while low prices are discouraging exports from india and the soviet union
silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations peru and mexico mr. demler *says*
meanwhile total fabrication demand for silver *has* risen six years in a row he *says*
comp*are*d with huge annual surpluses of more than N million ounces in the first half of the 1980s world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance mr. demler *says*
yet if gold prices improve silver prices could rally sharply he *says*
however dealers *caution* that any increase would be $ N to $ N at most
others said that the drop continued the downward correction that *'s* been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions
the mine *is* expected to return to production in about a week

the discounting *say* fast-food operators *occurs* on a scale and with a frequency they *have* n't seen before
the result *is* that some franchisees *are* running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less
it *'s* almost as if you *'re* doing extra work to give away the food he *says*
with fast-food outlets on every corner he like many *does* n't think he *has* a choice in the price war our customers *say* that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they *get* a coupon
the industry *is* overbuilt he *says*

usx corp. and its japanese partner *kobe* steel ltd. agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products mainly for the automotive market
the move by the nation 's largest steelmaker *follows* a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies
they *note* that most of the new plants will come on line in N when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports
there *'s* too much capacity contended charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets
i *do* n't think there *'s* anyone not building one
indeed usx said it *expects* the market for coated sheet steel to reach N million tons annually by N compared with N million tons shipped in N
for the first eight months of N analysts *say* shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about N N from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only N N
once you *make* up your mind about an investment the rest *is* easy right
there *are* all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways to get burned if you *do* n't know what you *'re* doing
two things to keep in mind not all exchanges *accept* every type of order
and even when a specific order *is* acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer
market order th*is* is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it *imposes* no price restrictions
with a market order an investor *tells* a broker to buy or sell at the market
it *'s* like saying get me in now or get me out now
for example if wheat *is* being offered at $ N and bid at $ N a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price
a recent indictment *alleges* that some floor brokers at the two largest chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers
limit order limit orders *are* used when investors *want* to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment
one risk investors may regret the restriction if the stock *reaches* N and then falls
stop order stop orders *tell* a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price *reaches* a certain level
once the price *reaches* that level a stop order *turns* into a market order and the order *is* filled at whatever price the broker can get
stop orders **are** sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses
while stop orders sound similar to limit orders there *is* a difference sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above
in contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders *are* placed below
if it ca n't be made at that price it *does* n't get filled
but if the market *moves* quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment *has* passed the specified price
but if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order *is* automatically canceled
i *like* to use them to feel out the market he *says*
if they *do* n't fill it immediately then i can start over at a new price or try again with the same price
it *is* a market order that *allows* floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they *think* they can get a better price by waiting
most brokers *assume* that all orders *are* day orders unless specified otherwise
it *is* always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they *have* placed
investors who *change* their mind about buying or selling after an order *has* been filled *are* usually stuck with the consequences
beta *is* a handy gauge that *measures* the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund
beta figures *are* widely available and easy to interpret
the beta of the broad market typically defined as the standard & poor 's 500-stock index *is* always N
so a stock with a beta of N **is** half as volatile one at N is N N more volatile and so on
remember though that beta also *has* important limitations
there **is** risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta *does* n't tell you the magnitude of that
in reality it *'s* very volatile but the movements *are* not because of market movements
if you *'re* like most people you said it *'s* a holding that *goes* completely sour maybe a bond that *defaults* or a stock whose value *disappears* in a bankruptcy proceeding
r*is*k is also a function of time
stocks *are* much r*is*kier than treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider
that *is* usually measured by the standard deviation or divergence of annual results from the average return over time
for instance some investors *have* sworn off stocks since the N market crash last friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings
they *estimate* the return a person 's current portfolio *is* likely to generate over time along with a standard deviation that *suggests* how much the return will vary year by year
they *try* to figure out the long-term results the person *needs* to meet major goals
for instance the insured municipal bonds that *dominate* the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk
but one price paid for the higher expected return *is* greater short-term volatility as reflected in the higher standard deviation that seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio
here *'s* how to interpret a standard deviation figure take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it
there *'s* a N N probability any year 's result will fall in the range
of course the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio *does* n't necessarily mean those investments *are* riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals
but while h*is*tory can suggest what is reasonable to expect there *'s* no guarantee that the past will repeat itself
for instance some analysts *believe* bond returns and volatility *have* moved permanently closer to those of the stock market

mr. schwartz *is* a business executive and writer in new york
now he *has* settled into a career that *fits* the bill financial planning
planners now *influence* the investment of several hundred billion dollars but in effect they *operate* in the dark
there *is* no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks a dog got into one trade group no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there *are* estimates *range* from N to N
but reform *has* n't taken hold yet
his group like others *wants* minimum standards applied to all who *call* themselves financial planners
the bad news however *has* n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning
but membership in the international association of financial planners *iafp* the industry *'s* biggest trade group *is* still nearly triple what it was in N and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who *do* n't belong to any group *have* soared as well
an estimated N million americans *are* now using financial planners and the pool of capital they *influence* *is* enormous
the sheer number of planners *makes* the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate
the most common conflict *involves* compensation
first meridian and its officials *are* currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general
civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds *are* increasingly common
two such actions both filed earlier th*is* year in georgia state court in atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name j. chandler peterson an atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the iafp as defendant
those companies in turn paid mr. peterson commissions and fees the suit *alleges*
one plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave mr. *peterson* $ N to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with mr. peterson
in affidavits each plaintiff *claims* mr. peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of N or the money returned
according to the suit mr. peterson *has* yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment
they *want* it back
mr. peterson *declines* to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he *prefers* to save such responses for court
but he *does* say that all of his activities *have* been entirely proper
mr. peterson *says* the suits against him ***are*** less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more prone to sue
i *do* n't know anybody in the industry who *has* n't experienced litigation he *says*
mr. peterson also *says* he *does* n't consider himself a financial planner anymore
he now *calls* himself an investment banker
other cases *go* to show that an old saw still *applies* if it *sounds* too good to be true it probably *is*

now you *discover* that you never learned the most important lesson how to send your kids to college
the reason *is* cost
a year at harvard now *goes* for $ N
so what *'s* a parent to do
some investment advisers *are* suggesting in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin
it never hurt anyone that *is* unless the growth funds *do* n't grow when you *need* them to
or the zero-coupon bonds *turn* out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition
that *'s* the dilemma for today 's parent
although many experts *are* advising risk no one *has* a good answer for you if the risk *does* n't pay off
the antitrust div*is*ion of the justice department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and *increases* among the top schools
and then there *'s* always state u
their message explicit or implicit *is* that a good college will cost so much by whenever you *want* it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore
they can cut this to $ N a month if the investing *keeps* up through college
and they can further reduce the monthly amount if they *start* saving earlier when mother and child *come* home from the hospital
not everyone *is* so pessimistic
he *takes* issue with projections that *do* n't factor in students ' own contribution which *reduces* most parents ' burden substantially
the situation you *want* to avoid *is* having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he *says*
that *'s* crazy
his advice *do* n't panic
parents he *says* should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford
half the amount that the investment *tables* suggest might be a good goal he *adds*
that way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time *comes* to pay tuition
their price *falls* further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates *kick* up
that wo n't matter if they *are* held to maturity but if for any reason the parents *need* to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal
the prepaid plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition *is* secure
mr. anderson *wants* the prestige *colleges* to sponsor such a plan
sponsors *are* naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns
but buyers *are* essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some *have* been encouraged to borrow to do so
one problem *is* that the internal revenue service *has* decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds *are* taxable
i *'m* not sure they *'re* going to make it work *says* mr. anderson
florida and wyoming *have* backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack

so term insurance may not be as cheap as it *looks*
there *are* all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others
amex sa*i*d it would charge me $ N a year for $ N of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums i put in if i canceled the policy after N years
*sounds* great or *does* it
that would be all right with amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it *does* n't add up to a smart money move for me
which *goes* to show that the first law applies in insurance as in anything else there **is** no free lunch there is only marketing
the fact **is** that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally *runs* a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into
that *'s* because you *have* to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package
so view permanent insurance for what it *is* a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment
you *pay* a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company *invests* that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends *grow* over the years
but the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free *is* very small
i *'m* not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so i *look* into the broad category called universal life
they commonly *give* two scenarios one **is** based on interest rates that the company *guarantees* usually N N to N N and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment often N N or more
projecting the latter over several decades i *find* my cash buildup *is* impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long
not likely i *think*
these *are* not certain either
another factor to consider some of the companies currently earning very high yields *are* doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you *know* how nervous the market *has* been about those lately
i *do* n't like the sound of that
and the feature *is* so new he *adds* that no insurer *has* yet established a track record for actually making such payments
i compared one universal policy for $ N face amount from such an insurer american life insurance corp. of lincoln neb. with a similar offering from equitable life assurance society of the u.s. which *operates* through N commissioned salesmen
the difference *is* magnified by time too
i *'m* thinking about using the $ N annual premium to finance a trip to paris first
a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more exciting while she *'s* doing it
his projection *indicates* profit in the latest quarter of more than $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or N cents a share a year ago
he said the company *is* still looking for a strong fourth quarter in all areas sales operating income and net income
hoechst said the fertilizer market *faces* overcapacity in western europe rising imports from east bloc countries and overseas and declining demand
the change in charter *does* n't alter the federal insurance of deposits federal regulatory powers or company operations a spokesman said
stock-index arbitrage *buy* programs in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences helped the rally 's momentum
it *'s* not good the market *is* setting up for another fall
outstanding contracts *are* those that *remain* to be liquidated
chemical and six other banks along with first boston *are* providing the rest of the $ N billion
paramount communications climbed N N to N N and mca rose N N to N both media companies *have* long been mentioned as potential acquisition candidates
investor robert m. gintel who *owns* a N N stake in the company said he *plans* a proxy fight for control of its board
among other technology issues *cray* research rose N N to N hewlett-packard added N N to N N *tandem* computers rallied N N to N N *data* general rose N to N N and motorola gained N N to N N
on the other hand symbol technologies dropped N N to N N after shearson lehman hutton lowered its short-term investment rating on the stock and its N earnings estimate and commodore international fell N to N after the company said it *expects* to post a loss for the september quarter
the company received shareholder approval for its restructuring plan designed to fend off a hostile takeover bid from a group headed by financier sir james *goldsmith*
the company said six officers *are* buying a total of $ N million of its stock
if you *think* you *have* stress-related problems on the job there *'s* good news and bad news
you *'re* probably right and you *are* n't alone
he added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims *is* about twice the average for all injury claims
even the courts *are* beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases according to a survey by the national council on compensation insurance
but his circumstances *are* among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in america
so this year the airlines *are* getting a jump on holiday discounts
they *are* cutting ticket prices by as much as N N from normal levels for travel to most u.s. locations on dec. N N N N and N and jan. N N and N
the continental catch only immediate family members *are* allowed and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they *'re* related
this *sets* things way back
just wait until you *'re* a bit older
senior citizens *have* long received cheap air fares
th*is* year the older someone is the bigger the discount
for every dollar earned over $ N social security recipients *lose* N cents of their social security benefits it *'s* like a N N marginal tax
but the compounded effects of seniors only taxes *result* in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates
he also *says* he *is* losing money now
he *blames* imports
he *credits* imports
the new market helped boost u.s. fur sales to about $ N billion a year now *triple* the level in the late 1970s
high-end u.s. furriers *say* these imports *have* n't squeezed them
yet mr. rosen *has* turned the import phenomenon to his advantage
by combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he *says* he *has* been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost
he *says* it *accounts* for N N of total sales
mr. rosen *is* also pushing retail sales
other furriers *have* also placed more weight on retailing
in other moves *mr.* rosen *says* he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers
since then he *has* expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the midwest
small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his new york showroom *have* become fair game
such moves *have* helped mr. rosen weather the industry slump of recent years
and those who did n't move some production overseas *suffer* labor shortages
the name of the game *is* to move goods
more than N people *work* in the gte building

in an apparent warning to currency traders who *have* lately been selling the british currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions
specifically he pointed out that compared with the u.s. market the u.k. *has* far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings
discussing future monetary arrangements *mr.* lawson repeated the thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system but he did n't indicate when
an olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories *are* already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in europe by december
what th*is* *means* is that europeans will have these machines in their offices before americans *do* the spokesman said
executives at olivetti whose earnings ***have*** been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market
although olivetti **'s** profits tumbled N N in the first half of this year she *believes* olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by december
the inflation adjustment also *means* that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that *generates* revenue for the social security trust fund will rise to $ N in N from $ N this year
this *means* that the maximum yearly social security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise $ N next year to $ N
suppliers were also hurt by the stronger u.s. dollar which *makes* sales abroad more difficult
in some cases competition *has* squeezed margins
but not every company *expects* to report increased earnings
hospitals companies meanwhile *are* reporting improved earnings
analysts *say* the handful of hospital companies that **are** still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends
most important hospital admission rates *are* stabilizing after several years of decline
these figures *are* n't seasonally adjusted
a labor department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits *reflects* the impact of hurricane hugo on southern states particularly north carolina and south carolina
the figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking nynex corp. workers who *have* become eligible for unemployment benefits the official said
the new line *is* aimed directly at international business machines corp
margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe *does* ship i *'m* not sure it will be a big winner
dec said its overseas business which now *accounts* for more than half of sales improved in the quarter
the bottom line *is* that it *'s* more hand to mouth than it *has* been before he said
he said current expectations *are* for an entry level machine to be shipped in december with all of the more sophisticated versions out by june
for reasons he would n't elaborate on he said he *'s* sure that schedule wo n't be met meaning less profit impact from the product for dec in the next few quarters
we *'ve* done a lot to improve u.s. results and a lot more will be done mr. mark said
improving profitability of u.s. operations *is* an extremely high priority in the company
the company 's domestic business especially its household products division *has* performed poorly for years
analysts *say* the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales
the company said it *believes* the suit *is* without merit
at&t said that based on studies of other companies that *have* offered retirement plans it *expects* about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program
under the amended pension program at&t managers who *have* at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes
managers who *retire* dec. N will have an additional N N added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age N whichever *comes* earlier
an at&t spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who *choose* to retire with new employees
th*is* is a good move but it only *gets* you to where people 's expectations already *are* in terms of earnings growth said joel d. gross an analyst with donaldson lufkin & jenrette
mr. gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ N million would result in even greater growth than the N N annual earnings increase at&t *has* told analysts it *expects* in the future
when it *comes* to buying and selling shares *westridge* capital management inc. *takes* a back seat to no one
every dollar 's worth of stock in the los *angeles* money manager 's portfolio *is* traded seven or eight times a year the firm *estimates*
that *makes* it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers according to securities and exchange commission filings
but *wait* a second
indexing for the most part *has* involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as standard & poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance
institutional investors *have* poured $ N billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that *promises* to post average market returns
and the fees investors *pay* for indexing run a few pennies for each $ N of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers
that *'s* because computers *do* most of the work and low trading activity *keeps* a lid on commission costs
but today indexing *is* moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one
now the interest *is* in what else can i *do* with that money
futures and options also *make* it possible to build synthetic index funds that *do* n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that *match* or *exceed* the broad stock market
strategies *vary* for westridge capital which *has* $ N million under management
and in some months he *buys* stock-index futures and not stocks at all
you *'re* buying the s&p and you always *want* to hold the cheapest form of it he *says*
prudential currently *is* seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the s&p N index plus N of a percentage point
there *are* many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds
they *include*
here a fund may promise to pay back *say* $ N of every $ N invested for a year even if the market *goes* much lower
that *leaves* $ N which could be used to buy s&p N options that will nearly match any gain in the s&p index
say a big investor *is* interested in growth stocks
people comfortable with the passive approach *are* using them for other strategies
th*is* is an index fund with a bet
another approach an investor with $ N million might use $ N million to buy the s&p N index and *spend* the other $ N million on a favorite group of stocks
other funds *have* been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment
traders who *sell* short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender
short interest *is* the number of shares that *have* n't yet been purchased for return to lenders
although a substantial short position *reflects* heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors *consider* an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back
the figures occasionally *include* incomplete transactions in restricted stock
the ratio *is* the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position
some analysts *suggest* however that the ratio *has* weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions
also closely watched *is* exxon corp. where short interest slid to N shares from N
the company *is* under an investigation concerning procedures to gain food and drug administration approval of generic drugs
the largest volume drop down N shares to N came in shares represented by b.a.t industries *plc* 's american depositary receipts

the earthquake that hit the san franc*is*co bay area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings officials at the two major rating agencies said
the only securities so far to be singled out *are* those issued by bay view federal savings & loan
as for property and casualty insurers *moody* 's said preliminary estimates *suggest* that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition but it *raises* concerns about potentially substantial risks longer-term
losses from the earthquake *are* expected to be of similar magnitude to those of hurricane hugo according to moody 's
nonetheless chairman roger w. johnson said he *expects* the company to be profitable in the current quarter
we *are* positioned to come through he said noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter
western digital *does* n't make the monitors

disk drives which *allow* a computer to access its memory generated N N more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier

minpeco now *says* it *is* willing to settle for up to $ N million from each brother although the actual amount would probably be much less
under it the former billionaire 's assets would be liquidated with the irs getting N N of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors including minpeco and manufacturers hanover trust co. which *is* seeking repayment of a $ N million loan
with support from the irs manufacturers hanover *has* filed suit asking judge abramson to subordinate minpeco 's claim to those of manufacturer hanover and the irs
minpeco said it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the w. herbert hunt case *is* approved by judge abramson who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week

polls *bear* out this warning but after a decade of increased republican influence here the new politics of abortion *have* contributed to a world turned upside down for mr. courter
in cherry *hill* the national abortion rights action league whose goal *is* to sign up N pro-choice voters *targets* a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause
abortion alone ca n't explain th*is* shift but new jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate
the times *are* my times *says* mr. florio
the same partnership **is** now crucial to mr. courter 's fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro-choice gov. kean
kean forces *play* down any differences with mr. courter but this history *makes* it harder for the conservative to run against government
i **do** n't think we do now he *says*
i *think* we did
with limited budgets for telev*is*ion in a high-priced market mr. florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage
auto insurance rates *are* soaring

the climb in wholesale energy prices *is* certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months they warned
though analysts *say* competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many *expect* some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year
still some analysts ins*is*ted that the worst of the inflation is behind
in the past several days however the u.s. 's central bank *has* allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets
excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists *call* the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only N N in september
all the numbers *are* adjusted for seasonal fluctuations
here *are* the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the labor department 's consumer price index for september
after watching interest in the sport plummet for years the ski industry *is* trying to give itself a lift
by some estimates nearly a fourth of all u.s. ski areas *have* been forced to shut down since the early '80s
but another big problem *has* been the aging of baby boomers
ski promotions *have* traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety
but the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she *tries* to get up from a fall
most people *think* if you *slip* you 'll wind up in a body cast
many resorts also *are* focusing more on the service side of their business
the ski industry *hopes* to increase the number of skiers by N million to about N million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions
but some *think* that *'s* being overly optimistic
for one thing it may be tough to attract people because skiing *is* still expensive a lift ticket can cost up to $ N a day and equipment prices *are* rising

this *has* been widely dubbed the bart series after the local subway line and the bay bridge series
still its edge *is* lost
the disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at campeau corp. *has* offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers
but two big new york banks *seem* to have kicked those chances away for the moment with the embarrassing failure of citicorp and chase manhattan corp. to deliver $ N billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp
for more than a decade banks *have* been pressing congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing wall street 's lucrative takeover game from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds
those expanded powers reached their zenith in july when bankers *trust* new york corp. provided mergers *advice* an equity investment and bank loans for the $ N billion leveraged buy-out of northwest airlines parent nwa inc
but the ual collapse he *says* may tell you it *'s* not going to work that easily
another N N of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which *offer* less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans
but he *warns* that banks will have to have enough discipline not to make loans that *are* too risky
we did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor *says* a bank spokesman
as evidence he *cites* yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $ N billion bid for american medical international inc. in which chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor
beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks *have* another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers
one hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was paramount communications *inc.* in its initial offer to acquire time inc. for $ N billion or $ N a share
the success of the nwa financing and the failure of the ual deal also *seem* to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by japanese banks
citicorp and chase *are* attempting to put together a new lower bid
inland steel industries *inc.* battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a N N drop in third-quarter earnings
the earnings also *mark* a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ N million or $ N a share
analysts noted that the disappointing results *do* n't reflect lower prices for steel products
structural steel which primarily *serves* the construction market was especially hurt by a N N price drop mr. bradford said
however he noted that steel mill bookings *are* up from early summer levels and that he *expects* the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter
when things *are* quiet low volatility the structures on which markets *stand* can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately
investors *lack* equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information
that structural lack *is* crucial because investors *are* the only source of market liquidity
when they *halt* trading all market liquidity *is* gone
and when any component of the market cash futures or options *loses* *liquidity* the price d*is*covery system the way prices *are* determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time
fear *is* the father of panic
because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility **are** forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information
contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers *do* not provide liquidity to the market as a whole
liquidity *is* not a service
it *is* a market *attribute* the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news
were we *smart* or just lucky
i *'m* not certain
now you *see* it now you *do* n't
the recession that *is*
for the past seven years investors *have* had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy
some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it *'s* like to invest during a recession
different tactics *are* called for as losing money *becomes* easier and making money becomes tougher
for those investors who *believe* or *fear* that N will be a recession year many economists and money managers *agree* on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio
but that may not be possible because recessions often *take* investors by surprise
they always *seem* to come a bit later than you *expect*
when they *do* hit they hit fast *says* david a. wyss chief financial economist at the data resources division of mcgraw-hill inc
though he himself **do*es* n't expect a recession soon mr. wyss *adv**is**es* people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is 20-year to 30-year treasury bonds
the reason *is* simple mr. *wyss* *says* interest rates almost always *decline* during recession
they *are* worth more because they *pay* higher interest than newly issued bonds *do*
that effect *holds* true for both short-term and long-term bonds
corporate bonds *are* usually not a good bet in a recession mr. wyss *says*
also he *notes* most corporate bonds *are* callable
when interest rates *have* dropped it *makes* sense for corporations to do just that they then *save* on interest costs
if corporate bonds **are** bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all
such bonds *are* very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster
municipal bonds *are* generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government
during an economic slump local tax revenues often *go* down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals
because he *sees* a N N to N N base rate of inflation in the economy he *doubts* that interest rates will fall much any time soon
instead mr. beach *says* investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he *means* such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and treasury bills
it *has* to be engineered over and over again month after month
and in a sense that *'s* the kind of task individuals *face* in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios
it *comes* down to a question of whether to try to time the market
for people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks *have* been rewarding long-term investments
that *'s* well above what bonds or bank certificates *have* paid
moreover because no one *knows* for sure just when a recession *is* coming some analysts *think* investors should n't even worry too much about timing
mr. katz *notes* that some economists *have* been predicting a recession for at least two years
frequent trading *runs* up high commission costs
still few investors **are** able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession *is* coming
by the time a recession **is** official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks *has* already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over
about six months before a recession *ends* stocks typically *begin* to rise again as investors *anticipate* a recovery
the average recession *lasts* about a year
for the portion of an investor 's portfolio that *stays* in stocks professionals *have* a number of suggestions
in good times he *says* they *lag* a bit but overall they *provide* superior performance
cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation *is* one common gauge of a company 's financial health
and it *'s* way above the ratio N *times* cash flow that bigger companies *are* selling for
food tobacco drugs and utilities *are* the classic examples
recession or not people still *eat* smoke and take medicine when they *'re* sick
keep some money available for opportunities he *says*
mr. dorfman *covers* investing issues from the wall street journal 's new york bureau
some industry groups consistently *weather* the storm better than others
the following *shows* the number of times these industries outperformed the standard & poor 's 500-stock index during the first six months of the past seven recessions
the *is*sue by chicago & north western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar
some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's *is*sue *shows* how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk
since last week 's junk-bond market debacle many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds *have* either been scaled back delayed or dropped
last week the grand union offering was sweetened to include warrants that *allow* bondholders to acquire common stock
dan baldwin managing director of high-yield investments at chancellor capital management said the chicago & north western offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now *are* demanding equity as part of the package
if you *'re* going to take the risk in this market you *want* something extra
mr. baldwin *likes* the offering
but several mutual-fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new *is*sues said they *'re* staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class
while they *consider* the chicago & north western issue to be good they *do* n't view it as the best
the bonds *are* expected to have a N N N coupon rate
the equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of N N of the stock of cnw *corp.* chicago & north western 's parent company
the closely watched funds rate *is* what banks *charge* each other on overnight loans
it *is* considered an early signal of fed credit policy changes
the fact that they did four-day matched sales *means* they *are* not in a mood to ease aggressively
here *are* details of the auction
rates *are* determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
thus higher bidding *narrows* the investor 's return while lower bidding *widens* it
california *expects* to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ N billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ N million to $ N billion in damages resulting from the quake according to a state official
if the refinancing plan *clears* congress there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them
but the problem clearly *is* widespread and persistent
running a charity *does* cost money but reputable organizations *manage* to get the lion 's sh*are* of donations out to where they are really needed
with *s*ome other charities however it s the other way around
both *deny* wrongdoing
meanwhile a state court judge *has* allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds
enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they *spend* the lion 's share of their income on fund raising
the attorney general 's office in connecticut alone *has* put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive *is* continuing there and elsewhere
the suit *is* still pending in illinois state court
what it *does* n't say *is* that the entire campaign may be the fund-raising letter itself
i *think* some people may believe they *'re* helping fund a massive tv and print campaign but we could n't find that the charity *does* anything except write these letters he *says*
the established charities *are* bothered by this but *say* they can do little about it
most of them *do* n't last for long but in the meantime all we can do *is* tell people they *are* n't connected with us *says* a spokeswoman for the american heart association
and sometimes a reputable charity with a household name *gets* used and *does* n't even know it
mr. johnson *is* a staff reporter in the wall street journal 's chicago bureau
specifically the british carrier said it currently *has* no plans to participate in any new offer for ual
company officials said later that british airways *believes* its involvement in the ual buy-out ended last friday when the buy-out group which also *includes* ual 's management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the $ N billion transaction
the transaction **has** had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last friday with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place
ual chairman stephen m. wolf who *is* leading the management end of the buy-out *has* n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal
in an interview wednesday with dow jones professional investor report mr. stevens said we *'re* in no way committed to a deal going through at all
we *'re* not rushing into anything
we *do* n't want to be party to a second rejection
ual 's advisers *have* indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they *want* to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid
they *have* maintained that banks *remain* interested in financing the transaction
a core group of six or so democratic senators *has* been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets
but senate majority leader george mitchell *d.* maine a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut called the group to meet with him wednesday night and again yesterday
having only a republican measure *makes* the task harder
but sen. *mitchell* buoyed by his victory among fellow democrats strongly disagreed
mr. mitchell *has* been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year
yesterday in an interview he added that the democrats ' decision *increases* the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year
the house version of the bill *does* include the tax cut
the president apparently will have only one bill to push sen. packwood 's and at least some of the dissident *democrats* *plan* to support it
i may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill *comes* to the floor said sen. david boren *d.* okla. a leader of those democrats
the packwood plan also would include a proposal designed by sen. william *roth* r. del. that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts
in addition long-term debt *has* been trimmed to about $ N million from $ N million since jan. N

much of what we *set* out to do *is* completed
i *do* n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now he said
we *have* to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient
it *'s* a process that never really *ends*
some of the coal the plants *buy* will come from westmoreland mines
westmoreland *expects* energy demand to grow annually in the N N range in the early 1990s

wall street **has** n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start
customers *hear* a lot of this stuff from people who *try* to sell them stock
either way the word broker *is* clearly out of favor
of the major new york-based securities firms only *morgan* stanley & co. still *calls* its salespeople brokers
at merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman *hutton* inc. they *are* financial consultants
at painewebber inc. they *are* investment executives
the names of some of these products *do* n't suggest the risk involved in buying them either
they *are* still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old label
in such cases the game *has* n't changed only the name
and *do* n't expect anyone to change the term blue chip either even though some of the companies that still *enjoy* the title may be riskier investments than they were
also blue chips in general *have* suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years
the reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management *bonuses* the price a sea of bad loans
the banks will threaten not to make further loans but in truth lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy they *have* no alternative but to go along
for the nine months *gillette* 's net income declined N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share in the N period
and before the week was out sony had offered mr. guber and his partner jon *peters* the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business
and they *are* a very odd team in any case
he *is* a lawyer with a string of academic degrees
on that film which *is* to start shooting in a few months they *'ve* been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script
i *wish* they were around N hours a day
but by and large this company *has* only been profitable
it *'s* no accident that they *'ve* been able to develop such successful material
he came to produce her records and her movies a star *is* born and the main event
mr. guber by contrast *has* been married to one woman for more than N years
peter *is* the bright sympathetic guy when you *'re* doing a deal *says* one agent
if there *'s* a problem peter disappears and all of a sudden jon *shows* up
we *are* the producers of that movie
mr. peters *acknowledges* that and *says* it *'s* not unlike the situation he and mr. guber *are* in with warner
some note that sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring mr. guber and letting mr. peters *stay* on to fulfill the warner contract
but though people in town may ask why guber *needs* peters it *'s* good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry *works* *says* steven tisch a producer who once worked for mr. guber
in the case of peter and jon the ink *has* been very very black
in N mr. guber got together with mr. peters by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of mr. *bogart*
the studio *says* it *stuck* with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for warner
mr. guber and mr. peters *maintain* that executives at warner *have* always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that warner never felt threatened until they linked up with sony
from the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream *says* mr. guber
on a number of occasions he *adds* he tried to get warner to buy guber peters outright
mr. guber and mr. peters *say* they got a look at the books and balked at the price
sony *is* paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ N million last year
mr. guber and mr. peters *claim* they *have* an oral agreement with warner executives that *allows* them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise
but in affidavits filed yesterday in the los angeles court *mr.* ross warner bros. chairman robert daly and president semel *deny* that such an oral agreement was ever made
mr. daly in his affidavit *acknowledges* that warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over mgm but *says* that situation was altogether different
moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of guber peters pictures for warner was n't as strong as it *is* now
warner itself was in negotiations with mgm over certain movie and other rights and it was in warner 's interest to accommodate mgm\/ua guber and peters by permitting them to become mgm executives *mr.* daly said in his affidavit
warner obviously *does* n't think that it *is* in its own interests to let mr. guber and mr. peters *go* off to columbia
during settlement talks for example warner demanded such things as cable tv rights to columbia movies and columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly *owns* with warner according to executives involved in the talks
mr. guber and mr. peters *refuse* to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the sony offer before taking it up with warner
in h*is* affidavit filed yesterday warner *'s* mr. ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument if sony *succeeds* here no written contract in hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on
first there *'s* the name asset-backed securities
better than all those offers you *get* to buy securities backed by nothing
and there *'s* more
the assets backing the securities *come* from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions
most *earn* high ratings from credit agencies
their yields *are* higher than those of u.s. treasury issues
and the booming market *has* already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors
the concept may be simple take a bunch of loans *tie* them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors
skeptics *say* the slightly higher returns *are* n't enough to compensate for the extra risk
they *warn* that asset-backed securities **are** only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to evaluate
moreover the securities were introduced only about N N years ago the biggest unknown *is* how they will fare in a recession
we *do* n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn
such concerns however *have* n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of wall street 's hottest new products
and the biggest volume this year *has* been on securities backed by credit-card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds
the result *is* a $ N billion market according to securities data co
that *includes* more than $ N billion issued through august of this year up sharply from $ N billion in the comparable N period and more than in all of N
most issues *have* been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions
but wealthy individuals also **have** been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market
the entry fee *is* affordable issues typically *are* sold in minimum denominations of $ N
the process typically *begins* when an institution such as citibank or sears *roebuck* & *co.* *takes* a pool of credit-card or other receivables and *sells* them to a specially created trust
the trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that *are* underwritten by wall street brokerage firms and offered to investors
enthusiasts *say* the booming market *has* opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions
asset-backed securities *are* an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds *says* craig j. goldberg managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at merrill lynch capital markets
but skeptics *question* whether asset-backed bonds *offer* sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks
on a $ N investment that *'s* a difference of only $ N a year
but if you *'re* an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that *is* n't of overwhelming importance
moreover the interest on asset-backed securities **is** fully taxable while interest on treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level
he *points* out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts
another concern *is* liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash
the secondary or resale market for asset-backed securities *is* relatively new and much less active than for treasury issues
that could make it tricky for investors who *need* to sell their holdings quickly before the securities *mature*
in addition an investor who *wants* to know the daily value of treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the new york stock exchange can simply check newspaper listings
there *are* n't any such listings for asset-backed securities
it *is* n't
in other words if there *'s* a problem *do* n't expect citibank to come to the rescue
the prospectus also *notes* that the securities *are* not guaranteed by any government agency
that also *is* n't easy
the letter of credit typically *is* not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities
nor *does* it cover the entire portfolio
still they *play* a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed **is**sues which in turn is why the yield above treasurys is so slim
when you *buy* an asset-backed issue you *take* the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties
underwriters *insist* these issues *are* constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions
some analysts *are* especially wary of credit-card issues
for one thing credit-card loans *are* unsecured
ratings he *notes* *are* subject to change
all this *makes* asset-backed securities *seem* too risky for many people
the response rate more than N N *allows* the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence
journal readers *are* relatively affluent with a median household income of between $ N and $ N
for example N N of this year 's respondents said they *expect* a recession within N months
an additional N N of this year 's respondents *expect* the economy to slow down during the next N months
apparently the respondents *do* n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much
a slim majority N N *think* stock prices will be higher in august N than they were in august N
their verdict on real estate *is* almost the same
some N N *expect* real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next N months
by contrast only N N *expect* an increase in the price of gold
since gold *tends* to soar when inflation *is* high that finding *suggests* that people *believe* inflation *remains* under control
nearly a third said they *have* made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession
about N N considered another crash likely while about N N said one *is* unlikely
and the respondents ' commitment to the stock market *remains* somewhat lighter than usual
mr. dorfman *covers* investing issues from the wall street journal 's new york bureau
a metric ton *is* equal to N pounds
health care property *holds* an interest in N facilities in N states
moody 's said it *expects* valley national of phoenix ariz. to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio and that it *continues* to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets and from high loan-loss provisions
by contrast european firms will spend $ N million this year on electronic security and *are* expected to spend $ N billion by N
moreover he said technology now *exists* for stealing corporate secrets after they *'ve* been erased from a computer 's memory
no personal computer not even the one on a chief executive 's desk *is* safe this speaker noted
the university said the two companies agreed to spend N million canadian dollars $ N million over N years on research at canadian universities if they *are* successful in acquiring the vaccine maker
the university *is* seeking an injunction against the merieux bid arguing that connaught 's predecessor company agreed in N that connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners
the university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if ciba-geigy and chiron *are* successful with their lower bid
it said the new agreement would replace the old one that *forms* the basis of its suit against the merieux takeover
there *'s* no pressure on otc stocks at this point said mr. mullins who said some buyers *are* beginning to shop among smaller otc issues
the company also *makes* optical character recognition equipment
in the N quarter the phoenix *ariz.* commercial banking concern earned $ N million
valley national said its $ N million prov*is*ion for credit losses and $ N million provision for other real estate owned is related to weakness in the arizona real estate market
the company said earnings for the year ending jan. N N *are* expected to be N to N cents a share compared with a previous estimate of N to N cents a share
the rest *is* of course history
instead he *says* they were cautious and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver on monday
china 's slide toward recession *is* beginning to look like a free fall
experts *predict* the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit
but while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also *runs* the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation
and because china 's leaders *have* abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy it *is* likely to continue analysts *say*
other fundamental reforms of the N act *have* been threatened as well
the senate finance committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts and also to bring back income averaging for farmers a tax preference that *allows* income to be spread out over several years
but lawmakers of both parties *agree* that the streamlining was temporary
other bills will be moving soon that *are* expected to carry many of the tax cuts including both the capital-gains and ira provisions
many groups *are* n't waiting that long
even lobbyists for heavy industry one of the interests *hit* hardest in the N bill *are* encouraged
the main obstacle *is* finding a way to pay for them
so *is* the tax code now open game again
he *throws* something
if it *does* not quite *have* chandler 's special magic well at the end neither did chandler
but there *are* grounds for complaint
but one *gets* fed up with importing information and news
and they *are* quietly linking up with u.s. publishing trade groups
while there *are* n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of sony corp. 's recent $ N billion agreement to buy columbia pictures entertainment inc. observers *do* n't rule out a transaction of that size
american publishers *appear* more than ready to do some selling
now they *realize* magazines *are* as much a franch*is*e as nabisco is a franchise
bell atlantic *corp.* and southern new england telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter while nynex corp. pacific telesis group and u s west inc. reported earnings declines for the period
he said the company *expects* to be on target with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter *represents* a significant challenge
our net income *is* n't where we would want it to be at this point said william c. ferguson chairman and chief executive officer
th*is* deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at new york telephone
pacific telesis said new telephone lines increased N N for a total of about $ N million for the quarter toll *calls* increased N N to N million and minutes of telephone usage increased to N billion
amoco *is* the first major oil company to report third-quarter results
analysts *expect* others to show a similar pattern
the industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity *has* depressed prices
gasoline margins may rebound this quarter some industry officials *say* but they *believe* chemical margins could worsen
for the nine months amoco said that net income fell to $ N billion from $ N billion but if unusual items *are* excluded operations produced essentially flat results
even if there **is** n't any widespread discounting the outlook for industry profits is n't good
industry observers *expect* a wide divergence in performance
economists *expect* general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise N N to N N from year-ago figures
catalog companies *are* likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year particularly in december
even sears roebuck & co. *is* getting into the act offering for the first time to have federal express deliver toys ordered by dec. N from its wish book catalog
he *'s* not predicting a blockbuster but he *is* more optimistic than three months ago because employment *remains* strong and inflation low
i *'m* not looking for a runaway christmas at all he *says*
the estimate *includes* the results of new stores
a consumer poll conducted in early september by leo j. shapiro & *associates* a market researcher based in chicago also *suggests* a modest holiday
of the N survey respondents N N said they **expect** to spend less buying christmas gifts this year than last year while N N said they expect to spend more and N N said their gift budget would stay the same
the results *are* almost identical to shapiro 's september N numbers
christmas *falls* on a monday creating a big last-minute weekend opportunity for stores
most will stay open late saturday night and open their doors again *sunday*
what you 'll hear as we *get* into december *is* that sales *are* sluggish predicts *woolworth* 's mr. *sells*
the older one **looks** like a member of the jury for a literary award the younger one looks like a novelist
will you pour me a drop of water if you *do* n't mind

that pace *is* causing some analysts to speculate that the soviet union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons
one sign that more soviet purchases *are* possible *is* that u.s. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts
that *sometimes* signals that they *are* laying plans to export corn
by buying futures contracts these companies *attempt* to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they *are* obligated to deliver
the harvest *delays* however *are* expected to be temporary
also the analyst said economic circumstances **are** such that both south africa and the soviet union the principal gold and platinum producers are being forced to continue selling the metals
both *are* in great need of foreign exchange and south africa *is* also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments he said
putting it all together we *have* a negative scenario that *does* n't look like it will improve overnight he said
in recent days however there *has* been increased purchasing of copper in london an analyst said

mr. belli like many other personal-injury lawyers *suspects* that the earthquake which measured N on the richter scale will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time
but lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases *reach* a judge
the major legal barrier *is* the principle that no one can be held liable for an act of god
we wo n't know until the smoke clears but *yes* we *'re* looking into it he *says*
mr. *belli* *says* he *wants* to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage
mr. belli who was at candlestick park for the world series tuesday night *says* he *has* hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse
plaintiffs he *says* will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards
the state *is* protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards *says* mr. covert
he *believes* those defenses might well apply to the bay bridge collapse
nevertheless he *adds* i would n't *get* totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the bay bridge

j. michael *cook* chairman of deloitte haskins & *sells* international said he *believes* the legal action by the british firm to be without merit
the merger *is* proceeding according to plan except as to the withdrawal of the deloitte u.k. firm he said
the prisons *are* too crowded
drugs *continue* to be sold openly around schools parks and housing projects
the defense department **has** lent the washington u.s. attorney N prosecutors and the federal bureau of investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training he added

new york times *co.* 's third-quarter earnings report *is* reinforcing analysts ' belief that newspaper publishers will be facing continued poor earnings comparisons through N
analysts said the company 's troubles *mirror* those of the industry
retail advert*is*ing which often *represents* half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers largely is n't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected
next year earnings will hold steady but we just *do* n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising
but many newspapers *are* facing similar comparisons
analysts said they were impressed by the performance of the company 's newspaper group which *consists* of the times N regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the international herald tribune group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to $ N million from $ N million on flat revenue

in only one presidential election year prior to N did more than N N of the nation 's congressional districts *choose* a different party 's candidate for the white house than for the house of representatives
as we *know* voters *tend* to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress
what *accounts* for the results of recent decades
if these assumptions *hold* voters in races for congress face what in economic theory *is* called a prisoner 's dilemma and *have* an incentive at the margin to lean democratic
each leg*is*lator after all is only one out of N when it *comes* to national policy making
in races for the white house a voter 's incentive at the margin *is* to lean republican
third the theory *suggests* why legislators who *pay* too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking *have* lower security in office
the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of N of the N freshman *republicans* brought into office in N by the reagan revolution and running for re-election in N
fourth the theory *indicates* why the republican party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office
finally the theory *suggests* why republicans generally *have* fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house
since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress th*is* is precisely the pattern one would expect if republicans *are* less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their democratic counterparts
th*is* is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the house

he said the original proposal *is* dead and all aspects of a revised version **are** up for change in light of the changes in ual 's market price the amount of debt banks are willing to fund and the price british air would be willing to pay

second the responsibilities of the federal reserve as guardian of the currency which *means* as guardian of the stability of the price level sometimes lead it to take measures that *are* unpopular
so the federal reserve *is* an attractive target for complaint by politicians
this *leads* to proposals for reform of the fed which *have* the common feature of making the fed more responsive to the administration to the congress and to public opinion without however any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians
some of these ideas *are* again under consideration in congress
but these proposals **do** not rest on a view of what the fed 's problem *is* or if they do they rest on an incorrect view
on the contrary it *is* too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest
the price level in the u.s. *is* now about N N times as high as it was N years ago

putting the secretary of the treasury on the board of governors one of the leading proposals today *is* an example
how should a reasonable member of the federal reserve board *interpret* a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board
the answer *seems* perfectly clear
true a succession of fed chairmen *has* given color to the notion that the secretary of the treasury belongs on the fed
the fed *exercises* a power given to it by congress and the president
but congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they *have* given the fed
the greatest contribution congress could make at th*is* time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the federal reserve system
legislation to this effect *has* been introduced in congress in this session by rep. stephen neal d. n.c
it **is** not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted however
people will say that the nation and the government *have* other objectives in addition to stabilizing the price level which *is* true
but that *is* not the same as saying that the federal reserve *has* other objectives
the government *has* other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives
and the fed *has* at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by *means* other than by stabilizing the price level
the two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the fed *are* high employment and rapid real growth

if anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in b.a.t 's share price since last friday 's sharp wall street sell-off *have* increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said
but this week b.a.t *has* been hit harder than other big u.k. stocks first by the market gyrations then by tuesday 's san francisco earthquake which could leave b.a.t 's farmers group *inc.* insurance unit facing big claims
we *are* n't forced sellers
analysts *estimate* that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly $ N billion
but the delay could happen if b.a.t *does* n't get adequate bids he said
b.a.t *has* declined to identify the potential bidders
though sir james *has* said he *intends* to mount a new bid for b.a.t once approval from u.s. insurance regulators *is* received jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and u.s. leverage buy-outs *are* making investors more skeptical about sir james 's prospects
market uncertainty also *clouds* the outlook for b.a.t 's attracting a premium price for its u.s. retailing properties

the provisions in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the house and senate could further cool the takeover boom that *has* been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s some tax experts and investment bankers *argue*
indeed some investment bankers *have* already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules
wall street *has* all but conceded on the *is*sue and is now lobbying for the less onerous senate version of one of the provisions
under current rules that *accrued* interest *is* deductible by the company issuing the debt
the house version of the leg*is*lation would kill that deduction and label any such debt as equity which is n't deductible
it *becomes* a source of cash for the company making the lbo because it *gets* a deduction and *does* n't have to repay the debt for several years
a second provision passed by the senate and house would eliminate a rule allowing companies that *post* losses resulting from lbo debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years
several wall street officials *say* the proposed leg*is*lation already is having an impact
one possible solution for wall street **is** to increase the equity part of the transaction that is give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments
the bill would then declare that the debt **is** equity and therefore is n't deductible
the senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest *is* actually paid
currently even though the *is*suer *does* n't pay tax the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest
but those holders *are* often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that *do* n't pay taxes on their holdings
the senate *estimates* that its version of the provision would yield $ N million the first year and a total of $ N million over five years

and the egg producers *have* done a pretty good job
now one might ask why people who *sell* eggs would fight someone who *is* trying to make it easier to crack them
part of the answer *lies* in the nature of the industry
but for companies that *use* hundreds of eggs a day breaking them by hand can get well out of hand
because fresh eggs *are* less expensive than processed ones a big egg user can recover the egg king 's $ N cost in a few months *says* mr. maynard
thus any machine that *breaks* large amounts of eggs at once *has* the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg *gets* in with the good ones
with nearly N machines in use there *have* been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed mr. maynard *boasts*
he *says* the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an egg king stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products
opponents *do* n't buy such arguments
leading the assault against the egg king *has* been united egg producers
so far new york new jersey nebraska georgia michigan and minnesota *have* outlawed mr. maynard 's device citing health concerns
an antitrust suit that *mr.* maynard 's company filed in los angeles federal court against the united egg producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes
mr. maynard *says* the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court

it also *creates* a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by eurocom and headed jointly by new york ad man jerry della femina and two top wcrs executives
wcrs 's restructuring *reflects* the growing importance of media buying in europe where the only way to get a good price on advert*is*ing time and space is to buy it in bulk
it also *gives* the outspoken mr. della femina who often *generates* as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international platform that he most certainly wo n't be loath to use
according to terms wcrs will pay N billion french francs $ N million for the N N it *does* n't already own of carat holding s.a. one of europe 's largest media buyers
it *implies* very dramatic growth he said
carat will receive its wcrs stake as part of payment for the N N carat stake that wcrs *is* buying while eurocom said it *expects* to pay about # N million for its wcrs stake
they and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and mr. della *femina* will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about $ N million

turkey **has** been fighting its past for years and thus far has been only partially successful
mr. dole 's odd effort notwithstanding most of turkey 's political problems *lie* with the europeans
part of the problem some europeans *have* with turkey *seems* to stem from its location turkey *is* n't really part of europe

housing and urban development 's budget *is* $ N billion
from what we and the nation *have* been reading the money *is* n't being spent very well
the single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor *is* to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods
instead they *'re* scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the hud scandal
no doubt many of h*is* ideas *are* worthy but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs *work* slightly more fairly and efficiently
congress *is* unlikely to go even that far
she *says* it 'd create N jobs and bring cleveland tourist revenue
the implication that if a congressman *calls* about a project in h*is* district there *'s* something wrong i *think* is most unfortunate
our view **is** that given congress 's attitude toward hud the place probably is beyond reform

the larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of san franc*is*co is surely with the state of the u.s. economy
but of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock its assets *means* nothing if the firm *is* not producing profits
th*is* is indeed what the market decided
from the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it *takes* only N cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's capital stock an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way
h*is* assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits thus restoring the market 's faith in them

japan air lines lufthansa german airlines and air france reportedly *plan* to form an international air-freight company this year a move that could further consolidate the industry
the action *follows* federal express corp. 's acquisition of flying tiger line inc. in august
mr. daly said such discussions *are* motivated by the competitive threat posed by federal express united parcel service of america inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies
many airlines *are* talking about cargo ventures and there *have* been rumors about such a tie between jal and european airlines
but he said jal *is* talking to lufthansa and air france about some sort of cargo venture
in frankfurt a lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks *are* under way but declined to comment
nothing *is* defined or signed at this point mr. daly said of the talks
whatever accord the three carriers *reach* he said he *is* skeptical it would create a separate airline
if the three companies *pool* their air-freight businesses their clout would be considerable
air france and lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that *includes* air-freight activities
they currently *have* large orders for cargo planes
several airlines including lufthansa jal and cathay pacific airways **are** working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join mr. daly said

even as the stock market *has* generally done well this year ibm 's shares *have* slipped steadily from its 52-week high of $ N
the company *has* spent some $ N billion over the past N N years to buy back N million common shares or roughly N N of those outstanding
we *view* it as a good long-term investment the spokesman said
in the short term the move *is* likely to have little effect
first it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes *ibm* 's bread-and-butter business
finally ibm had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives which *account* for N N of its $ N billion of annual revenue
none of the problems *is* necessarily fatal and they *are* n't all necessarily even related
there **are** also other factors at work that are outside ibm 's control such as currency exchange rates
the strong dollar which *reduces* the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they *are* translated into dollars *is* expected to knock N to N cents off ibm 's per-share earnings for the full year
still investors will take some convincing before they *get* back into ibm 's stock in a big way
fluor *corp.* a construction engineering firm gained N cents to $ N

nearly N options traders on the chicago board options exchange who cle*are*d trades through petco including a handful of traders who lost between $ N to $ N million themselves as a result of friday 's debacle are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms *cboe* members said
over the weekend *fossett* *corp.* another options trading firm transferred the clearing accounts of about N traders to first options of chicago a unit of continental bank corp. because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after friday 's market slide
the head of another small options clearing firm who asked not to be identified said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years *makes* it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business
never mind that her husband prefers *crest*

while brand loyalty *is* far from dead marketing experts *say* it *has* eroded during the 1980s
what *'s* more a flood of new products *has* given consumers a dizzying choice of brands many of which *are* virtually carbon copies of one other
without some real product improvements it *'s* going to be difficult to win that loyalty back
the wall street journal 's american way of buying survey this year found that most consumers *switch* brands for many of the products they *use*
overall N N of consumers *are* n't brand loyal for any of the N product categories
about N N *are* loyal for one to five of the products
only N N *are* brand loyal in N to N of the categories and no one *is* loyal for more than N types of products
coke and pepsi *are* all the same to me and i usually *buy* whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale
the high score *reflects* the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women
he *believes* there *'s* opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty
marketers *speculate* that more affluent people *tend* to lead more pressured lives and *do* n't have time to research the products they *buy* for the highest quality and most reasonable price
an establ*is*hed brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality if not always the best value for the money
it *'s* sort of loyalty by default
they *'re* buying whatever 's cheaper
but now that they *'re* settling down and raising families might they also *show* more stability in their brand choices
mr. kim of j. walter thompson *does* n't think so
earlier generations were brand loyal across categories he *says* but boomers *tend* to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances
advertisers *attribute* this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands
but most companies *are* too afraid to take that chance
now *philip* morr*is* kraft general foods ' parent company is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for maxwell house *says* dick mayer president of the general foods usa division
even though brand loyalty *is* rather strong for coffee we *need* advertising to maintain and strengthen it
campbell soup co. for one *has* concluded that it *makes* good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who *buy* competitive brands
the best odds *are* with your core franchise

insurers *face* the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week 's california earthquake
aetna and other insurers *are* hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage

state farm mutual automobile insurance co. the largest home and auto insurer in california *believes* the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ N million in damages it *expects* to pay out for claims resulting from hurricane hugo
state farm said about N N of its policyholders in california *have* also purchased earthquake insurance
the association of california insurance companies estimated damage to residential property could total $ N million but only $ N million to $ N million *is* insured it said
they *expect* to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two
roads and bridges in the bay area *appear* to have suffered some of the most costly damage
highways such as the section of interstate N that collapsed in oakland generally *do* n't have insurance coverage
however the bridge which *charges* a $ N toll each way *does* have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge *is* interrupted for more than seven days
earthquake-related claims *are* n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole
instead even with the liabilities of two natural d*is*asters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear
for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they *buy*
reinsurance *is* protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves
he *suspects* some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by hurricane hugo
although it *'s* unclear how much exposure the london market will face u.k. traditionally *have* a large reinsurance exposure to u.s. catastrophe coverage
he *is* estimating this week 's disaster will generate insured losses of $ N billion to $ N billion following about $ N billion in costs to insurers from hurricane hugo
the company said it also *is* making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management
jaguar plc 's chairman said he *hopes* to reach a friendly pact with general motors *corp.* within a month that may involve the british luxury-car maker 's producing a cheaper executive model
besides creating joint manufacturing ventures the accord *is* expected to give gm about a N N stake that eventually would rise to about N N
jaguar *figures* a friendly alliance with gm will fend off unwelcome advances from ford motor co
but ford jaguar 's biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to N N th*is* week is pressing harder for talks with sir john
we *'re* getting to the point where we *are* going to have to meet with him one ford official said yesterday
ford *has* signaled it might acquire a majority interest later
i *'m* not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody the jaguar chairman asserted yesterday
sir john noted that *gm* a longtime jaguar supplier *agrees* we should remain an independent company
jaguar shares stood at N pence before ford 's initial announcement but the subsequent takeover frenzy *has* driven them up
a typical brit*is*h executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car
we **have** designs for such executive cars but have never been able to develop them sir john said
we *have* to make it attractive enough that holders would accept it sir john said
that may be difficult the jaguar chairman acknowledged when you *have* somebody else breathing down your neck

the arizona real estate market *continues* to be depressed and there *is* still uncertainty as to when values will recover james *p.* simmons chairman said
the dec*is*ion to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders he said
the addition to reserves *comes* on top of a provision of $ N million that was announced in june
that *'s* the way a lot of brokers *feel* today on the second anniversary of the N stock-market crash
i *think* it will shake confidence one more time and a lot of th*is* business is based on client confidence
customers and potential customers *are* suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash N
i can just tell the questions *are* right back where they were what *'s* going on ca n't anything be done about program trading *does* n't the exchange understand where *is* the sec on this
but these wide swings *scare* them to death
but those *do*llars *have* been going into such safe products as money market funds which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms
a slightly higher percentage of new york stock exchange volume *has* been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash N according to securities industry association data

senate republicans *have* settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations
at the same time a small group of senate democrats *are* working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon
sen. bob packwood r. ore. the lead sponsor of the gop proposal said he *intends* to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation *comes* along particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit
the packwood plan would also include a proposal designed by sen. william *roth* r. del. that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts
no one in the senate *is* considering the capital-gains plan passed by the house

the construction industry *is* sure to feel increased demand
in greenwich conn. lone star spokesman michael london *says* obviously with an earthquake of this size there *are* likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated
but any increase *is* n't likely to be any kind of a surge
it *'s* something likely to be spread out over a long period of time
the first effects *are* of course negative as work *is* disrupted and people *lose* income and cut spending
subsequently however the ill effects *are* likely to be offset at least in economic terms as construction activity *begins*
because of the way the government *keeps* its books the damage to the bay bridge however costly wo n't be counted as a minus
you certainly can say it *'s* going to be extremely severe
mr. goldberg *says* the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $ N billion and could reach $ N billion
the independent insurance agents of america *says* fewer than one of every five california homeowners *has* earthquake insurance

still any change in east germany *has* enormous implications for both east and west
because mr. krenz *has* been very much in accord with the policies of honecker
according to west german government sources *mr.* honecker and several senior politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change
but with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity mr. honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle officials *say*
although other resignations may follow it *'s* still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change
clearly the central figure in th*is* process is egon krenz
like west german chancellor helmut kohl he *represents* the postwar generation that *has* grown up during germany 's division
west german government officials and western analysts *are* doubtful
at the same time the expectations of the east german people *are* great and will continue to grow
not just that people **are** being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously
chancellor kohl meanwhile *has* invited mr. krenz to open discussions with bonn on a wide range of subjects

instead of hoping to sell h*is* usair stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of $ N a share mr. steinhardt is stuck with roughly N million usair shares that cost him $ N on average but yesterday closed at N N up N in new york stock exchange composite trading
at the current price the usair holding *represents* N N of all the assets that mr. steinhardt *manages*
a week ago usair stock briefly soared above N after a report in usa today that mr. steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators *say* they were skeptical
moreover unlike mr. buffett who often *holds* big stakes in companies for years mr. steinhardt *has* n't in the past done much long-term investing
meanwhile his big losses for instance in N 's crash generally *have* been trading losses
analysts *say* usair stock might lose four or five points if the steinhardt stake was dumped all at once
in recent days traders *say* usair *has* been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million usair shares though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program

such disclosures of big holdings often *are* used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers and to stir interest in the stock
analysts *say* usair *has* great promise
however mr. steinhardt *says* he *'s* comfortable holding usair as an investment

commodore *has* seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the u.s. where its personal-computer sales *have* been so d*is*mal for years that commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts
but those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly even if they *turn* out to be the right ones

the stock of applied power inc. which split 2-for-1 in may *has* risen since august N
the stock market 's dizzying gyrations during the past few days *have* made a lot of individual investors *wish* they could buy some sort of insurance
after all they wo n't soon forget the stock *bargains* that became available after the october N crash
called a married put the technique *is* carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock
because a put option *gives* its owner the right but not the obligation to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date the investor *is* protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price
but most investment advisers *do* n't recommend using married *puts* all the time
th*is* is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods *are* on fire *says* mr. roth
you always *want* your house insured but you *do* n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured
the investor will be out the cost of the put which *is* called the premium and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit
if the stock *stays* at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put
if the price of the stock *declines* the put will increase in value
once the stock price *is* less than the exercise price or strike price of the put the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar
when a stock *falls* below the put 's strike price the investor simply **sells** the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit
brokers *handle* such transactions through the options clearing corp. which *guarantees* all option trades
the accompanying table *shows* how this strategy would work for three stocks
for example tenneco inc. *pays* a quarterly dividend of N cents which would be received before the february option expires and thus reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount
there *are* more than N stocks on which options may be bought and sold including some over-the-counter stocks
they can do this by purchasing index puts which *are* simply put options on indexes that *match* broad baskets of stocks
unlike options on individual *is*sues index options *are* settled only in cash and no stock is ever tendered
normally once the underlying investment *is* suspended from trading the options on those investments also *do* n't trade
that cost *rises* in times of high market volatility
a call option *is* similar to a put except that it *gives* its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration
selling a call option *gives* an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline
that *'s* because it *reduces* the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call
but if the price of the stock *r*is*es* above the strike price of the option the stock is almost certain to be called away
and in that case the investor *misses* out on any major upside gain
these calculations *exclude* the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock
all prices *are* as of monday 's close
many members *feel* there *are* important features of the house bill that should be enacted speaker thomas foley d. wash said

a surprising surge in the u.s. trade deficit raised fears that the nation 's export drive *has* stalled and caused new turmoil in financial markets
this bad trade number *raises* some deeper issues about the market decline said norman robertson chief economist for mellon bank
in N however the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade while the current report *comes* after a period of improvement
but the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit *has* run out of steam
the figures today *add* further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit *has* essentially stalled out at a level of about a $ N billion annual rate said jeffrey scott a research fellow at the institute for international economics here
many economists *contend* that deep cuts in the u.s. budget deficit *are* needed before further trade improvement can occur
that *'s* because the budget deficit *feeds* an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export
people ***are*** sick and tired of hearing about these deficits but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem said mr. robertson
in addition the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months *has* increased the price of u.s. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness
since march exports *have* been virtually flat
most economists *expect* the slowing u.s. economy to curb demand for imports
the best result we could *get* from these numbers would be to see the administration and congress get serious about putting the u.s. on an internationally competitive economic footing said howard lewis vice president of international economic affairs at the national association of manufacturers

a computer with the optical device will still cost $ N but from now on next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who *have* already bought next machines
mr. jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who *are* frustrated with the performance of the optical device which *is* n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals
another factor was that customers were asking why *do* n't you give us a cheaper system mr. jobs said at a conference on university computing here
to get around the delays caused by the optical device businessland which *is* next 's exclusive dealer to corporations *has* for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines
we *'re* extremely committed to optical storage technology he said
we *think* everything will go this way in a few years
he said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives but he *depends* on outside suppliers for the devices
universities however *say* next 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students *purchase* the machine

in august soon after wang laboratories inc. reported a staggering $ N million loss and replaced its president two boston sales representatives sent customers a letter saying we fully *expect* that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the amazing comeback at wang
how soon wang will stage a comeback or if it will at all *are* still matters of debate
but wang salespeople *are* trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face selling the products of a company that *is* on the ropes
like thousands of salespeople before them *wang* 's *are* finding ways to combat the bad news
after the company reported red ink for the f*is*cal third quarter wang 's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as how could you not have known you were going to lose $ N million and is wang still a viable company
we *tell* them all the major companies *are* having financial difficulties
mr. miller *says* that after a sharp sales slump in july and august sales stabilized in september
although wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended sept. N and the full fiscal year mr. miller *says* he *expects* the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter

that *is* n't easy
before the really bad news we were looking at wang fairly seriously she *says*
but their present financial condition *means* i 'd have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing
during the past year wang *has* developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president
the first priority for wang 's sales force *is* to make sure it *holds* on to existing customers
wang 's installed base *is* one of its greatest assets and many of those customers *remain* extremely loyal
new customers the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to wang 's long-term viability *are* even tougher
the financial problems *are* particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing wang 's image systems which *convert* paper forms to electronic documents

lung-cancer mortality rates for people under N years of age *have* begun to decline federal researchers report
the drop *is* particularly large for white males although black males and white and black women also *show* lower mortality rates
the report which *comes* N years after the u.s. surgeon general **is**sued a report warning against the dangers of smoking is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer
the national cancer institute report *compares* mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of N and N a decade apart
although lung-cancer mortality rates *are* increasing for the nation as a whole the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year N for women
lung-cancer mortality rates *increase* with age and *are* continuing to rise for all age groups over N with sharp increases for everybody but white men
however he stressed that the improvement *depends* on a continued reduction in smoking
even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality *affect* all sex and race groups they ca n't be taken for granted the report *says*
according to the american cancer society smoking *is* responsible for N N of the lung-cancer cases among men and N N among women

mr. seidman who *has* been the nation 's top bank regulator inherited the problems of lincoln based in irvine calif. after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law

it could n't sell its south american *routes* one of the major assets marked for disposal
since then eastern **has** been negotiating with creditors over revisions but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions
the committee *has* two groups of experts it *calls* on to analyze eastern 's plans
ernst & young said *eastern* 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest tax and depreciation by $ N million and that eastern 's plan presented no comfort level according to a source present at yesterday 's session
other costs also would increase including maintenance because eastern *has* an older fleet
these accounts *hold* several hundred million dollars primarily from asset sales
the plan eastern *hopes* to pursue he said *calls* for eastern to have $ N million in cash by year 's end
as to negotiations with creditors *mr.* lorenzo said in remarks after the conference we 'll have to see how they *talks* *come* along
however he added it *'s* not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors
under bankruptcy law eastern *has* exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan
that deadline *has* been extended once and could be extended again

bankers *trust* new york corp. became the latest major u.s. bank to increase reserves for its loans to less-developed countries making a $ N billion third-quarter addition to its provision
the bank also said it *expects* to report a $ N billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year
the new reserves *bring* the company 's provision for loans to third world countries to $ N billion or N N of bankers *trust* 's medium and long-term loans to these countries
bankers trust *has* had the capacity to do this for some time the analyst said
he *expects* citicorp to take a similar step this year
citicorp yesterday reported a N N third-quarter earnings drop which analysts called a bit disappointing while manufacturers *hanover* corp. posted a $ N million loss for the quarter after adding $ N million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries
wells *fargo* & co. of san francisco posted a N N jump
but he reiterated the bank 's position that it *is* comfortable with the current level of $ N billion covering about N N of the $ N billion of such loans outstanding
a concerning item the analyst cited was the N N jump in expenses which the bank *attributes* to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business
citicorp 's spokesman said however that the bank *is* maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth
wells *fargo*
as a result *wells* fargo 's net interest income rose $ N million or N N to $ N million for the quarter
the combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave wells *fargo* a N N return on average assets for the quarter about N N higher than security pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the u.s.
wells *fargo* 's return on equity increased to N N from N N
that trend and *wells* *fargo* 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs *are* about the only worries analysts *have* about wells fargo 's financial picture
wells fargo *is* rebuilding its loan-loss reserve which increased to $ N million at sept. N from $ N million the previous quarter but was down from $ N million a year ago when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans

and among domestic programs the most serious threat *is* white house opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the district of columbia and department of health and human services
markets usually *get* noticed because they *soar* or *plunge*
the december N contract which *has* the greatest trading volume ended at $ N an ounce
gold tried to rally on monday but ran into the same situation that *has* subdued gold prices for more than a year selling by gold producers who *want* to fix the highest possible price for their gold
december delivery gold **is** trading in a range of $ N to $ N an ounce and is having difficulty breaking out above that mr. savaiko said
investors in the u.s. and europe *are* comfortable with the actions of the federal reserve in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system which helped the stock market rebound on monday he said
there *is* n't any rush on the part of investors in the west to buy gold he said
it *'s* an experience they *do* n't want to repeat
there *is* little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market *goes* higher it may be just a false alarm
mr. mehta observed that the u.s. merchandise trade deficit which rose sharply in august according to yesterday 's report *has* been having less and less impact on the gold market
the dollar **has** n't reacted much to it so gold has n't either he said
since stock market indexes plummeted last friday participants in all markets *have* been wary
when traders *become* confident that the stock market *has* stabilized oil prices *are* expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration
according to an analyst cuba ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and *has* asked japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year into early next year
japan *is* perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar the analyst said
another analyst noted that cuba *has* been deferring shipments in recent years
cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains *are* making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef
traders **are** especially sensitive to reports of possible u.s. soybean sales because u.s. exports are lagging
moody 's said it *is* assessing the strategies *ryder* 's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets
the rating agency said it *is* focusing especially on the transportation service company 's efforts to control costs *improve* margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business vehicle leasing and rental
but the nations of europe and north america *have* decided they *know* better
fortunately the nations of southern africa *have* n't totally surrendered their sovereignty
that *'s* not fair they *'re* not all fat
the small business administration *has* received more than N formal requests for disaster loans because of the hurricane
local bankers and accountants *help* applicants fill out forms
the garage owners *say* they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years
the repair shops *are* n't united however
shops represented by the automotive service industry *association* and the motor equipment manufacturers association *oppose* any increase in warranty length
moody 's investors *service* inc. said it lowered ratings on about $ N million of beatrice co. debt citing the closely held chicago food concern 's proposed recapitalization
the terms of the geneva accords *leave* moscow free to provide its clients in kabul with assistance of any kind including the return of soviet ground forces while requiring the u.s. and pakistan to cut off aid
since the troop withdrawal moscow *has* poured in an additional $ N to $ N million worth per month nearly $ N billion since february equivalent to the total u.s. aid to the resistance in nine years
moscow claims th*is* is all needed to protect the kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance
but th**is** is not the entire afghan army and it is no longer kabul 's only military force
even if not all these forces **are** committed to the regime they are now dependent on it
cuban military personnel also *have* been active in afghanistan since N
moreover serious questions *have* been raised about the claimed withdrawal of soviet forces
this heavy outside support for the worst *has* undermined better moderate leaders
the wonder *is* not that the resistance *has* failed to topple the kabul regime but that it *continues* to exist and fight at all
last summer in response to congressional critic**is**m the state department and the cia said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive
creation of a new real*is*tic u.s. policy is long overdue
yet he *asserts* you *look* around and you *say* who *are* the leaders
who *is* going to carry the water
it *is* n't surprising that president bush *has* n't led a crusade to pump up the contras or sdi
you *hate* to do it because he *'s* your father
of course neither president bush nor the congress *has* actually abandoned the contras or sdi
but the administration *has* dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels
and the administration 's deal with congress *gives* several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month though the committees *are* likely to let aid continue until february
instead of focusing on the contras *mr.* bush *has* switched to urging members of congress most recently in a white house meeting yesterday to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of nicaragua 's sandinista government
the administration *continues* to support sdi or star wars and it recently lobbied to persuade the senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program
the house *has* already voted for a deep cut in funding and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year
it will be hard down the road to persuade congress to approve money for sdi plans if lawmakers *fear* those plans could scuttle a completed treaty
above all though proponents *say* neither the contra nor the sdi cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support
we *'re* sorry to report that on monday president bush accepted the resignation of william allen as chairman of the u.s. civil rights commission
we *'ve* actually read the speech
he said that other participants in the conference *do* not believe that the rights of americans should be guaranteed to citizens who *are* homosexual but that i *mean* to persuade you to the opposite view
he *says* the title of his speech was to make his point that americans *have* rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups
what *'s* really going on here
the three most important things to understand about mr. allen **is** that he is a black conservative intellectual a triple threat to the liberal establishment
indeed the gap *is* so large that *mr.* allen 's critics *refuse* to engage the debate
their effort to run him out of washington *is* an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement
he *has* been a bearings director since N
the appointments *are* part of a planned succession at the company
sale of the solution in concentrated form to commun*is*t countries is prohibited by japanese law and by international agreement

major european auction houses *are* turning increasingly to specialized sales
however they said the company 's flat revenue was a disappointment and an indication that sales of polaroid 's new conventional film in the u.s. *have* been sluggish
if you *believe* that a good performance next year **is** contingent on an acceleration of revenue there is n't a lot here to base optimism on
alex henderson an analyst with prudential-bache *says* polaroid officials told him yesterday that u.s. sales of the company 's new conventional film product introduced in the second quarter *have* been disappointing after a promising start
why *is* the stock market suddenly so volatile
and apparently it *is* here to stay
but most *are* linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly
but when they *discover* that markets *are* n't always as liquid as they supposed markets *jump*
trading in futures and options some people *believe* can add to volatility
investors *believe* they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks that *is* a way of staying liquid even when they *own* stocks
these and other modern trading methods *tend* to promote dramatic shifts in assets *says* george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc
others *are* doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures
but institutions *say* wall street brokerage firms *are* less willing to make markets
brokers *do* n't deny that
wall street traders *say* that with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock
why should i risk money for a guy for who *'s* paying me five cents a dance
all you *get* *is* risk
many traders *say* that circuit breakers *put* in place to damp volatility after the N crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged friday
then they said by the way two of the doors *are* locked
the takeover mania also *adds* to volatility
ual corp. *is* a good example
presumably ual *is* now trading closer to its value based on earnings
some experts *say* markets *are* n't as volatile as widely assumed
john j. phelan jr. chairman of the big board *asserts* that N and N *have* been two of the least volatile years in the last N or N years
but the low average volatility mr. phelan **is** talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week
it *leads* investors to focus on short-term price movements a game of musical chairs he called it rather than on long-term fundamental valuation

a second illustration *is* supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by robert freeman formerly head of arbitrage at goldman sachs & co

yet all these *is*sues *are* subsidiary to a more central issue who is and who should be making the criminal law here
courts and legislatures *make* decisions in very different ways and *are* each susceptible to very different kinds of errors
thus a court *is* poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule
in the past not only would reputable professionals *have* rushed to check out such rumors with the company but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts
today after mr. freeman 's plea there **is** an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient

that *puts* pressure on cd rates
conservatives *have* an important decision to make this fall
its role in the economies of developing countries *has* grown steadily since the 1970s
at least three other factors *have* encouraged the imf to insist on increased capital
first it *argues* that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it *feels* some responsibility
while international politics may argue for the capital increase there *is* a clear economic case against it
decisions on increases in the imf 's capital base traditionally *are* made by the administration with subsequent authorization by congress
the issues *are* too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose
if conservatives *do* n't support an increase in the imf 's capital then it *is* incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative

he added we *do* n't intend to be drawn into it noting that tci wo n't play any active role in the management of showtime
tci said it may bring in other cable operators as investors a practice it *has* employed in the past with investments in other cable networks such as the discovery channel

wcrs *has* been in discussions with eurocom for several months
the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that *shows* little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and *cites* problems associated with the practice
dual trading *gives* an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers
critics *contend* that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders
traders *are* likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading *provides* a way to make money in slower markets where there *is* a shortage of customer orders
the exchanges *contend* that dual trading *improves* liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they *do* n't have a customer order in hand
the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that *need* additional liquidity *are* expected to be among them
the study by the cftc 's div*is*ion of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said
so far one test of restricting dual trading *has* worked well
the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures *pit* in N

it *'s* too soon to tell but people *do* n't seem to be unhappy with it he said
he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange *has* seen the full proposal

the ghosts of the past **are** everywhere they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget
so far no one *has*

now his ghost wo n't let up till it *'s* done
he gave those bureaucrats *charge* of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean
marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers *someday* maybe they would get the whole navy
but who *'s* counting
meanwhile congress *is* cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget
questions like that really *stir* up marshall 's ghost
marshall 's ghost *is* satisfied for now but he 'll be back

late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that *suggests* deep concern about an institution
mr. paul **has** a plan to bring in $ N million by selling off N of centrust 's N branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators
centrust shares *have* fallen sharply in price from a high of $ N in N to close yesterday at $ N
the great collectors we depended on such as paul mellon or norton simon *have* stopped buying and the new buyers *are* brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting
trouble *is* mr. bond **has** yet to pay up and until he *does* sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key
and he *tells* me if you *want* to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in florida
it *'s* just not true he *says*
mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of george *wachter* a sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the guterman items
mr. *hall* *says* mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money
european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which *sotheby* 's north america had lately been touting in this country
mr. paul *says* it was n't that high
in other words *get* rid of all the pictures
mr. paul *says* that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at sotheby 's
he *owns* N N of centrust 's shares
adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests *insist* that he relying rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the centrust collection
it *'s* not beyond credibility the rubens will someday be worth $ N million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow *remains* to be seen

mr. paul *claims* to have sold three paintings at more than a N N profit
he furthermore *denies* that he relied too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. wachter
people *hold* out and try to get a bargain
mr. *wachter* *says* mr. paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment
sotheby 's she *says* *is* wearing both hats
estimates **are** based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be
frequently clients express interest in paintings but **do** n't end up bidding she *adds* so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be
mr. paul in selling off h*is* paintings is seeking at least a N N return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound

investors *are* n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either
earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales *mr.* rosenthal added
those days *are* over now he *believes*
competition from third parties who *have* cash and *are* prepared to buy *has* always existed and will continue added mr. rosenthal
th*is* is no longer true today
to make an lbo work now we *are* going to need more than just junk bonds
none *believe* the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at b. altman & co. which *is* under chapter N bankruptcy protection
institutions that usually *buy* retail paper *have* to be more concerned
however the lower prices these retail chains *are* now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt
in addition the fall selling season *has* generally been a good one especially for those retailers *dependent* on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues
what *'s* encouraging about th*is* is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said joseph e. *brooks* chairman and chief executive officer of ann taylor *inc.* a specialty chain

industry analysts *predict* that by N south korea will be building three million cars a year about half of that for export
it *'s* an optimistic move in a industry already facing world-wide overcapacity
but south korean auto makers *are* confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in korea will stay strong
currently only one in N south koreans *owns* a car up from one in N a decade ago
the reason for the tremendous demand *is* simple south koreans suddenly *have* a lot more money
pay raises of N N over the past three years *have* given many south koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world

if it *does* n't he *says* the company would have to change its expansion timetable
for small companies he *says* interest rates *are* far more important than what *happens* on stock exchanges
partly because the N market crash made it harder for them to find financing many high-technology concerns *have* made such alliances recently
instead they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies he *says*
this will add to the appeal of small business he *says* where investors often *have* a degree of influence
bay said a substantial part of its debt outstanding *is* in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made

moreover the process *is* n't without its headaches

but unfortunately that segment *is* much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel

in addition ibm noted that the stronger dollar *has* cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they *are* translated into dollars
the computer giant whose u.s. results *have* been dismal for years noted that revenue rose again in the u.s. in the third quarter following an increase in the second period
the company said in a statement that demand for ibm products and services *continues* to be good world-wide
we *do* not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth
analysts *worry* that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter
and the input i *'ve* had from customers *is* that it still could be a while
he said ibm *has* priced its leases aggressively thinking that would help win business
he said ibm **has** not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases
ibm **is** gaining momentum in the personal-computer market and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year
but it *'s* hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days and the workstation market while important *is* too small to rely on for much growth
pepsico inc. 's chairman said he *is* more than comfortable with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to at least N cents to $ N a share from N cents the year earlier

while monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors *recoup* losses many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses traders here and in new york said
options traders were hurt worse than others on friday because of the highly volatile nature of options which often *rise* or *fall* in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they *are* based
thus options traders *friday* were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in new york
the damage was so bad at fossett *corp.* an options trading firm here that it was forced to transfer its accounts to first options of chicago a unit of continental bank corp. as a result of options trading losses
officials at options clearing corp. which *processes* all options trades for u.s. exchanges said that the $ N million guarantee was unprecedented but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets

but several weeks ago in the wake of the beijing *killings* the loan was canceled according to bankers and executives close to the project
while some commercial lending *has* resumed international lenders *remain* nervous about china 's economic troubles and foreign debt $ N billion at the end of N
the project known as lotus mansion *has* been mired in controversy
creditors involved in the project *contend* however that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations
instead the creditors *say* the loan fell victim to nervousness about china 's political turmoil as well as to concern about the loan 's security

the s&p N contract that *expires* in december closed up a record N points on volume of nearly N contracts
several of wall street 's largest securities firms including salomon brothers *inc.* and *painewebber* inc. were also large buyers traders said
brokerage firms as a rule *do* n't comment on their market activity
now *i* *feel* maybe there *'s* a little bit of euphoria
there ***'s*** a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good
analysts at standard & poor 's *say* junk bond offerings by tightly stretched issuers *seem* to be growing
it *'s* possible to have a N N default rate in one year because we *'re* already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy
i *'m* certainly not comfortable saying we *'ve* seen the bottom
in contrast he *says* the stock market gained back only about half what it lost friday and the government bond market lost about half what it gained friday
i *think* the market *is* in good shape
that *'s* a question a lot of people *are* asking following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility
the answer *say* academic researchers money managers and investment special*is*ts is yes as long as you *approach* the stock market as an investor
but they *say* people should n't try to be traders who *buy* and *sell* in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock
the case for owning stocks over the long-term *is* compelling
if you *look* at N years worth of investment history including the great depression and every bear market since stocks *have* outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot *says* barry berlin vice president at first wachovia capital management
the longer the time period the less r*is*k there is of losing money in the stock market
over time the odds increasingly *favor* the investor with a diversified portfolio
stocks *have* a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he *says*
he *says* individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as high-quality bonds
despite the strong case for stocks however most pros *warn* that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments
our markets *move* so fast and they *are* so volatile there *'s* no way the average investor can compete with the pros
individual investors *face* high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market
and assuming their first investment *is* successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains
that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes *are* included mr. *lipper* *says*
after that individual traders *face* the risk that the new investment they *choose* wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing
so what *'s* the best way to buy stocks
unless an individual *has* a minimum of between $ N and $ N to invest in stocks he *'s* still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker *says* mr. lipper
it *'s* now selling at a multiple about even with the market *says* mr. douglas
moreover mr. douglas *sees* a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term
we *'re* seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he *says*
they *say* that **'s** especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes
buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he *says*
in th*is* method a person *invests* a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down
that *cuts* the risk mr. gregory the san francisco money manager points out
when the market *is* low you *are* buying more shares and when it *'s* high you *'re* buying fewer shares he *says*
otherwise if you *put* all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and *have* to wait three years to get even mr. gregory *says*
a disciplined program will work the best mr. boesel *says*
one of the hardest things to do **is** to buy stocks when the market is down he *says*
but that *'s* just the time when you should be buying them
donald trump who faced rising doubt about his bid for american airlines parent *amr* corp. even before a united airlines buy-out came apart friday withdrew his $ N billion offer
after reaching an intraday high of $ N the day mr. trump disclosed his bid *oct.* N amr 's stock had retreated as low as $ N last week
some takeover stock traders had been betting against mr. trump because he *has* a record of disclosing stakes in companies that *are* potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid
he *'s* done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it
he *'s* written this book the art of the deal
why *does* n't he just *follow* through on one of these things
mr. trump withdrew h*is* bid before the amr board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it
yesterday *mr.* trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the ual deal on congress saying it was rushing through a bill to protect amr executives
i *believe* that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the ual transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past friday mr. trump wrote members of congress
some analysts said amr chairman *robert* crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees
i *'m* sure he still *wants* amr
officials familiar with the talks said citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $ N a share but said that price was a talking point and that no decision *has* been made
officials familiar with the bank talks said the ual buy-out group ual pilots management and brit**is**h airways *plc* is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its $ N million equity contribution
nor *is* the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next N hours despite the hopes of many traders
the group 's advisers *want* to make certain they *have* firm bank commitments the second time around
even if the buy-out group *is* able to obtain financing the transaction still *faces* obstacles
ual 's board could reject the new price as too low especially since there *are* n't any competing bids
if they were to insist on a low bid of say $ N a share the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots *oppose*
also because ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual executives *have* joined the pilots ' bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders
influential members of the house ways and *means* committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts
the bill *intends* to restrict the rtc to treasury borrowings only unless the agency *receives* specific congressional authorization
the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law *includes* raising $ N billion from debt issued by the newly created rtc
another $ N billion would be raised through treasury bonds which *pay* lower interest rates
but the rtc also *requires* working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that *are* sold until the assets can be sold separately
that debt would be paid off as the assets *are* sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ N billion or $ N billion including interest over N years
the agency *has* already spent roughly $ N billion selling N insolvent s&ls and it *is* likely to sell or merge N by the time the bailout concludes
we would *have* to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward he said
the law *does* allow the rtc to borrow from the treasury up to $ N billion at any time
the ways and *means* committee will hold a hearing on the bill next tuesday
we *'re* about to see if advertising works
this time around they *'re* moving even faster
shearson *lehman* hutton inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads
a lot of investor confidence *comes* from the fact that they can speak to us he *says*
to maintain that dialogue *is* absolutely crucial
today 's fidelity ad *goes* a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity
it *goes* on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name
in the aftermath of the N *debacle* the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night
taped just as the market closed yesterday it *offers* ms. farrell advising we *view* the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle
we *continue* to feel that the stock market *is* still the place to be for long-term appreciation
if you owned it and liked it *friday* the true value *has* n't changed
we *do* n't think at this point anything *needs* to be said
in any case the brokerage firms *are* clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of N
but it *remains* to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective
you *know* what the law of averages *is* *do* n't you
i *'m* for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday
i *choose* to believe it *'s* the latter although it probably *springs* from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a 's and giants *is* originally from somewhere else

included in the increase in the most recent quarter *is* a $ N million loan which ncnb said it *expects* to be fully repaid with no loss early in the fourth quarter

security pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter but the los *angeles* bank holding company was still able to post a N N increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans

the new york stock exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers if the dow jones index *falls* N *points* in a day the exchange will halt trading for one hour if the decline *hits* N points the exchange will close for an additional two hours
it **is** impossible to know whether that theory is realistic
at N after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and *washington* the futures exchanges reopened
futures trading however was halted altogether at N after the futures markets had dropped an additional N points which *is* the daily limit for price declines
at this point the options markets also *shut* down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new york stock exchange
it therefore *makes* no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers
the new circuit breakers if they *are* to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading *continue* as long as the new york stock exchange *remains* open

how such remarks *translate* into policy wo n't become clear for months
others said the bush admin*is*tration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand

i *see* no major support until N
i *see* a possibility of going to N this month
most people he *says* *have* no idea what a massacre pattern *looks* like
friday 's big drop she *says* was not a crash
now as in those two years her stock market indicators *are* positive
so she *thinks* the damage will be short-lived and contained
th*is* is exactly the same thing as far as i *'m* concerned
my advice *is* to buy
she *says* that ratio could climb to N given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value
there was a unique combination in N he *says*
over the next several months though he *says* things *look* bad
i *think* the market will be heading down into november he *says*
he *expects* the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N sometime next year
that would be a normal bear market he *says*
i *guess* that 's my forecast
i *expect* the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability
unlike N interest rates *have* been falling this year
unlike N the dollar *has* been strong
but the economy 's slower growth th*is* year also *means* the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he *says*
so it *'s* a very mixed bag
thus he *concludes* th*is* is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks
i *see* this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he *says*
this *has* both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable
nevertheless he *says* a depression *does* n't appear likely
companies *are* still going to buy companies around the world he *says*
examples *are* ford looking at jaguar bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting
stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis *are* a great opportunity this week for guys like me he *says*
he *sees* economic problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession
friday you could n't sell dollars he *says*
mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he *sees* how the london and tokyo markets *go*
many people now *claim* to have predicted the N crash
if it promptly *cuts* the discount rate it *charges* on loans to banks he *says* that could quiet things down

my colleagues and i fully *realize* we *are* not a court etc
apparently their verdict *is* in

that *'s* not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice
no doubt that *'s* partially true
he *'s* right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it *comes* to obtaining information from prior hud officials
of course we *'ve* also got a judiciary that *seeks* the same objective
the system *is* the problem not an individual member
i *do* not by any means *defend* hud management
market makers *keep* supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances *occur*
on days like friday that *means* they must buy shares from sellers when no one else *is* willing to
it helped that h*is* inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said
but they *are* worried
it wo n't take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he *says*

the $ N billion *california* public employees retirement system for one added $ N billion to its stock portfolio two years ago
even friday 's slump *leaves* investors ahead more than N N well above the annual average for stocks over several decades
all that now *has* changed
we *'re* not making a killing but we had a good day
there *are* some very significant issues out there such as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with japan that *have* to be the subject of major initiatives he said in an interview
i 'd like to see that initiative and i *have* n't
there *is* n't a big shot an agenda
but mr. butcher 's comments *make* one thing clear some on wall street wonder if anyone *is* in charge of economic policy
the administration *has* sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers
but he *has* since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision
some analysts *say* uncertainty about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop
but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome *does* n't seem likely this year
nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that *have* developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight
hill democrats *are* particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation
there *is* no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell *d.* maine said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation

i *'m* not losing faith in the market said boston lawyer christopher sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm
but he *'s* not so sure about everyone else
i *think* on monday the small investors *are* going to panic and sell predicted mr. sullivan whose investments *include* amr corp. 's american airlines unit and several mutual funds
and i *think* institutions *are* going to come in and buy
i *'m* going to hold on
if i *sell* now i 'll take a big loss
he *has* four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he *wants*
i *have* this feeling that it **'s** built on sand she *says* that the market *rises* but there 's no foundation to it
she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the N crash although she still *owns* some texaco stock
partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school i *think* at this point we *want* to be a lot more liquid
others *wonder* how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand
now it *'s* happening again
this time he *'s* ready to buy in when the panic *wears* off
still he *adds* we ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often
when the little guy *gets* frightened the big guys *hurt* badly
but it *'s* not only the stock market that *has* some small investors worried
analysts *say* they **'re** faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they 're priced aggressively at $ N to $ N
one analyst noting that most such machines *are* about two inches thick *takes* exception to the name
the market *is* so new nobody *knows* yet how big it can be
whether it *'s* $ N billion or $ N billion it *does* n't matter
it *'s* huge
size and weight considerations also *have* limited screen displays
zenith holders will vote in december on the proposed $ N million sale a price that could slip because it *is* pegged to zenith 's share and sales
compaq *is* already taking aim at zenith 's market share
we *do* n't *look* at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he *argues*
analysts *do* n't see it that way
the problem compaq **is** going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them
others undoubtedly will follow but most analysts *believe* compaq *has* at least a six-month lead on the competition
a third model marketed in japan may hit the u.s. by the end of the first quarter of N but by then analysts *say* compaq will have established itself as one of three major players

investors who bought stock with borrowed money that *is* on margin may be more worried than most following friday 's market drop
that *'s* because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans
typically a margin call *occurs* when the price of a stock *falls* below N N of its original value
but some big brokerage firms said they *do* n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls
margin *calls* since friday *have* been higher than usual but reasonable a spokesman for shearson lehman hutton inc. said
merrill lynch & co. officials *do* n't expect margin *calls* to be as big a factor as in N because fewer individual investors *are* buying stock on margin a spokesman said
he said schwab had increased margin requirements so customers *have* more of a cushion
but it *remains* involved in programs with amr corp. 's american airlines unit and delta air lines
analysts and competitors however *doubt* the numbers were that high

we *'re* after a little bigger niche he said
*do* n't jump yet
in one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration *has* been trying to do unsuccessfully for weeks
that *has* changed partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history *have* been reasonably comfortable
there *'s* nothing rational about this kind of action
of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market *continues* to dive this week
growth *is* slower
profits *are* softer
debt burdens *are* heavier
but if the stock market *does* n't continue to plummet the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate
fed officials may protest that this *does* n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies
but the experience of the N crash *suggests* the fed *is* likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets
tiny movements in the rate which *is* what banks *charge* each other for overnight loans *are* usually among the few visible tracks that the fed *leaves* on the monetary markets
the consensus among econom*is*ts is that it grew a much more sluggish N N in the third quarter of N which ended two weeks ago

first boston corp. projects that N of the N companies it *follows* will report lower profit
still some industry giants *are* expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business *is* outside commodity chemicals
monsanto co. too *is* expected to continue reporting higher profit even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern europe and the western u.s.
searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but monsanto *has* said it *expects* searle to post a profit for all of N

dismal sales at general motors *corp.* dragged the u.s. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early october the first sales period of the N model year
the heavy use of incentives to clear out N models *appears* to have taken the steam at least initially out of N model sales which began officially oct. N
this *appears* particularly true at gm which had strong sales in august and september but saw its early october car and truck results *fall* N N from last year 's unusually high level
some of the u.s. auto makers *have* already adopted incentives on many N models but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up

the debate over national service *has* begun again
president bush *has* outlined his own youth entering service yes *plan* though its details *remain* to be specified
what *is* one to think of all this
doctrine and special interests *govern* some responses
if the market wo n't pay for it they *argue* it ca n't be worth its cost
let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service *has* no agreed meaning
what *kinds* of work would they do
what *does* national mean
as commonly understood service implies *sacrifice*
it *involves* accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career
but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government *encourages* many kinds of behavior
N good programs *are* not cheap
full-time residential programs also *require* housing and full-time supervision they *are* particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale
*are* they worth that
people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there *are* many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost
they *are* unlikely to be employed
some wo n't accept the discipline others *drop* out for other reasons
but some whom nothing else *is* reaching *are* transformed
strictly speaking these youth *are* not performing service
but they *believe* themselves to be serving and they *begin* to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future
that *is* a service to the nation
it *is* what federal support should try hardest to achieve
he *is* a co-author of national service what would it mean
it *is* prepared to assume the same role it played in october N providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat
the fed *provides* money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions
secretary of the treasury brady and chairman greenspan and the chairman of the sec and others *have* been in close contact
but in this context that *'s* the smart thing to do
today 's stock market decline *does* n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy he said
the other *is* that we *see* another major disaster like two years ago
i *think* that *'s* less likely
as a result they *have* extensive knowledge in financial markets and financial market crises
aides *say* he continued to work the phones through the weekend
and as of last night fed chairman greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the american bankers *association* convention in washington at N a.m. this morning
that *'s* the advice of most investment professionals after friday 's 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average
and investment pros *are* divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months
indeed some pros *see* friday 's plunge plus any further damage that might occur early this week as a chance for bargain hunting
but most advisers *think* the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat
on the other hand it *'s* not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy
so it *'s* more prudent to wait and see how things *stabilize*
but he also *thinks* it *is* a good week to consider buying
we *'re* dedicated long-term investors not traders he *says*
one camp of investment pros *sees* what happened friday as an opportunity
over the next days and weeks they *say* investors should look for stocks to buy
friday 's action was an old-fashioned panic *says* alfred goldman director of technical market analysis for a.g. edwards & sons in st. louis
and mr. craig *expects* to pick up more shares today
it will be chaotic at first but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble he *says*
he *argues* that stocks **are** reasonably valued now and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of N
mr. front of stein roe suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that **have** lagged the market on the up side or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction
other investment pros *are* more pessimistic
they *say* investors should sell stocks but not necessarily right away
he *says* the oct. N employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector *is* a warning sign to investors
one strategy for investors who *want* to stay in but *hedge* their bets *is* to buy put options either on the individual stocks they *own* or on a broad market index
a put option *gives* its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock index for a specified price the strike price until the option *expires*
it *'s* totally different
we *'re* in a service business and in that context it *'s* vital to *have* your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success
employees *have* the right to trade stock among themselves and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions

the mmi and the s&p N *are* the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies

still the lesson *is* about the same on friday the 13th the market was spooked by washington
the consensus along the street *seems* to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the ual takeover and it *'s* certainly true the rout began immediately after the ual trading halt
and market expectations clearly *have* been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month
