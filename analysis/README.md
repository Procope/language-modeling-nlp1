Here we search for agreement and government phenomena in the Penn Treebank, and we analyse such phenomena with our language models.

`data.py`, `model.py`, and `ran.py` are the same files you can find in `language-modeling-nlp1/recurrent`. 
They are in this module only for (not unsolvable) compatibility reasons.
