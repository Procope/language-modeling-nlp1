 fujitsu ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly <unk> for his company 's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects while computer rival nec corp. made a written <unk> for <unk> in the same practice 
 meanwhile business and government leaders <unk> the computer makers and <unk> about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about japanese <unk> pricing 
 fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a u.s. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years 
 the company also disclosed that during that period it offered N yen or about $ N for another contract 
 but fujitsu japan 's no. N computer maker is n't alone 
 nec one of its largest domestic competitors said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since N 
 in both cases nec lost the contract to fujitsu which made the same bid and won a <unk> <unk> 
 all the contracts were for <unk> contracts and involved no hardware or software 
 the ministry of international trade and industry summoned executives from the companies to make sure they understood the concern about such practices according to a government spokesman

 japan 's fair trade commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible <unk> violations 
 we would like to <unk> for having caused huge trouble fujitsu president <unk> <unk> read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company 's downtown headquarters 
 the bids he added were contrary to common sense 
 nec released a statement saying we feel sorry for having caused trouble to society a form of <unk> common in japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations 
 japanese companies have long had a reputation for <unk> short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits 
 but the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having <unk> affairs are coming under close ethical scrutiny 
 the fire is also fueled by growing international interest in japanese behavior 
 so far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue 
 but in one of the auctions in question international business machines corp. made a bid substantially higher than the fujitsu offer according to the <unk> 
 the <unk> bids touch on issues central to the increasingly <unk> trade debate 
 foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in japan in part because japanese companies unfairly undercut them 
 the u.s. government in recent years has accused japanese companies of <unk> slashing prices on semiconductors and <unk> products fujitsu and nec make 
 asked whether the bidding <unk> would hurt <unk> relations mr. <unk> said this will be a minus factor 
 the <unk> controversy first came to a head last week when the city of hiroshima announced that fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to <unk> its waterworks 
 the city had expected to pay about N million yen $ N but fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free 
 then wednesday fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in <unk> <unk> two weeks earlier 
 it also said that in july it bid N yen to design a system for the <unk> <unk> library and two years ago it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for <unk> <unk> 
 the company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in hiroshima and <unk> 
 the municipalities said they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts 
 fujitsu and nec said they were still investigating and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge 
 mr. <unk> insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids and that he did n't know about most of the cases until wednesday 
 other major japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids

 lsi logic corp. reported a surprise $ N million third-quarter net loss including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing <unk> slowdown in semiconductor demand 
 in september the <unk> maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $ N million to $ N million net loss for the third quarter 
 but company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $ N million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more <unk> production techniques 
 over the summer months there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector our primary market said wilfred j. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer 
 in addition recent industry forecasts for N indicate a slow environment at least until midyear 
 as a result the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and make appropriate reductions in operating expenses 
 the $ N million net loss <unk> N cents a share 
 not counting the extraordinary charge the company said it would have had a net loss of $ N million or seven cents a share 
 a year earlier it had profit of $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the charge partly reflects a switch from older <unk> to <unk> <unk> silicon <unk> with which to <unk> chips 
 related to that decision the company said it was converting its santa clara calif. factory to a research and development facility 
 a spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force

 the dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday buoyed by persistent japanese demand for u.s. bond issues 
 while market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish u.s. economic indicators dealers note that japanese demand has helped <unk> the dollar against the yen and has kept the u.s. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark 
 at the same time dealers said the u.s. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks in part because the hefty japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark 's strength resulting in a <unk> 
 jay <unk> with capital insight inc. reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well the mark climbed to N yen from N yen late tuesday in new york the strength of the u.s. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds rather than mark bonds

 douglas madison a corporate trader with bank of america in los angeles <unk> the dollar 's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings 
 he contends that the perception in japan of a <unk> u.s. response to sony corp. 's announcement of its purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc. has been temporarily <unk> 
 he cites the recent deal between the mitsubishi estate co. and the rockefeller group as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed japanese company in the georgia-pacific corp. takeover bid for great northern nekoosa corp. as evidence 
 the <unk> maturity in november of a 10-year japanese government <unk> bond issue valued at about $ N billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors <unk> the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments according to mr. madison 
 it remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over 
 meanwhile traders in tokyo say that the prospect of lower u.s. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by japanese institutions

 the managers ' index which measures the health of the manufacturing sector stood at N N in october above september 's N N and also above average forecasts for the index of N N

 the reruns have helped ratings at many of the N network affiliates and independent tv stations that air the shows 
 but the ratings are considerably below expectations and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire 
 meanwhile stations are <unk> because many of them say the show 's distributor viacom inc. is giving an <unk> either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing cosby to a competitor

 garbage magazine billed as the practical journal for the environment is about to find out 
 founded by brooklyn n.y. publishing entrepreneur <unk> <unk> garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight <unk> on the u.s. waste crisis 
 the magazine combines <unk> pieces on topics like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet and <unk> pieces on alleged environmental offenders 
 garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a <unk> <unk> through supermarket <unk> in a bid to identify corporate america 's good guys and bad boys 
 in one feature called in the <unk> editors point out a product they <unk> to be a particularly bad <unk> 
 from an advertising standpoint the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days 
 with only two issues under its belt garbage has <unk> some would-be advertisers and raised the <unk> of others 
 campbell soup for one is <unk> its <unk> <unk> microwave product was <unk> in the premiere in the <unk> column 
 the magazine 's editors ran a giant <unk> of the product with <unk> pointing to the packaging 's <unk> foam <unk> and <unk> film all plastic items they say are <unk> 
 it 's precisely the kind of product that 's created the municipal landfill monster the editors wrote 
 i think that this magazine is not only called garbage but it is practicing <unk> garbage <unk> a spokesman for campbell soup 
 he says campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment 
 modifications had been made to the <unk> <unk> product at the time the issue was printed he says making it less an <unk> than was portrayed 
 he admits though it is n't one of campbell soup 's better products in terms of <unk> 
 campbell soup not surprisingly does n't have any plans to <unk> in the magazine according to its spokesman 
 some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off madison avenue 's big <unk> 
 you really need the campbell <unk> of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it says mike white senior vice president and media director at ddb needham chicago 
 the economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base of big-time ad <unk> he adds 
 the first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers including general electric and <unk> coors but the majority were from companies like waste management inc. and <unk> international firms that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul 
 a waste management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase and it does n't have any plans to <unk> in future issues 
 we do n't spend much on print advertising she says 
 but ms. <unk> the magazine 's editor and publisher contends garbage can survive at least initially on subscription revenues 
 individual copies of the magazine sell for $ N and yearly <unk> cost $ N 
 it is of course printed on recycled paper 
 according to ms. <unk> <unk> journal corp. her publishing company printed and sold all N copies of the premiere issue 
 the first and second issues sold out on <unk> she says and the magazine has orders for N <unk> 
 asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine 's direct policy ms. <unk> replies i do n't know and i do n't care 
 i 'm not saying advertising revenue is n't important she says but i could n't sleep at night if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad

 sea containers ltd. said it might increase the price of its $ <unk> buy-back plan if pressed by temple holdings ltd. which made an earlier tender offer for sea containers 
 sea containers a hamilton <unk> shipping concern said tuesday that it would sell $ N billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about N N of its common shares for $ N apiece 
 the move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two european shipping concerns <unk> holding ag and <unk> plc 
 in may the two companies through their jointly owned holding company temple offered $ N a share or $ N million for sea containers 
 in august temple sweetened the offer to $ N a share or $ N million 
 yesterday sea containers ' chief executive officer james <unk> said in an interview that under the <unk> plan sea containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $ N million 
 about $ N million of that would be allocated to the buy-back leaving about $ N million he said 
 that $ N million mr. <unk> said gives us some flexibility in case temple raises its bid 
 we are able to increase our price above the $ N level if necessary 
 he declined to say however how much sea containers might raise its price 
 mr. <unk> speculated that the <unk> that sea containers has means that temple would have to substantially increase their bid if they 're going to top us 
 temple however <unk> criticized sea containers ' plan yesterday <unk> it as a highly conditional device designed to <unk> management <unk> shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer 
 a spokesman for temple estimated that sea containers ' plan if all the asset sales <unk> would result in shareholders receiving only $ N to $ N a share in cash 
 the lower figures the spokesman said would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that sea containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market 
 temple added that sea containers is still mired in legal problems in <unk> where the supreme court has temporarily barred sea containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by <unk> and <unk> 
 the court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month 
 temple also said sea containers ' plan raises numerous legal regulatory financial and fairness issues but did n't elaborate

 the transportation department responding to pressure from safety advocates took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles 
 the department proposed requiring stronger <unk> for light trucks and minivans beginning with N models 
 it also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to <unk> light trucks and minivans with <unk> belts for rear seats beginning in the N model year 
 such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats 
 today 's action transportation secretary samuel skinner said represents another <unk> in the ongoing program to promote vehicle <unk> safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards 
 in september the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same <unk> <unk> that have long been required on passenger cars 
 the big three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans 
 safety advocates including some members of congress have been urging the department for years to extend <unk> requirements to light trucks and vans which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the u.s. 
 they say that many vehicles <unk> as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars 
 they did n't have much luck during the reagan administration 
 but now there seems to be a fairly <unk> effort to address the problem said chuck <unk> vice president of communications for the insurance institute for highway safety 
 we 're in a very different regulatory environment 
 sen. john <unk> r. <unk> praised the department 's actions noting that <unk> crashes account for almost half of all <unk> deaths 
 we could prevent many of these <unk> with minimum <unk> standards he said 
 sen. <unk> and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved <unk> protection 
 the department 's <unk> proposal would apply to vehicles weighing N pounds or less 
 the <unk> would be required to withstand a force of N times the <unk> weight of the vehicle 
 during the test the <unk> could n't be depressed more than five inches

 one of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of <unk> wines limited in production of <unk> quality or so perceived at any rate and with <unk> high prices

 these first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ N to $ N a bottle 
 in the last year or so however this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members 
 the <unk> have <unk> in price to meet the competition and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the <unk> single bottle among current releases from every major wine region on the globe 
 france can <unk> the lion 's share of high-priced bottles 
 <unk> 's first <unk> from N and N are $ N to $ N each except for the smallest in terms of production <unk> <unk> which costs around $ N 
 these prices seem rather modest however in light of other french wines from current <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> the leading <unk> now goes for well over $ N a bottle for a lighter vintage like N the <unk> rich N runs $ N

 the <unk> salon is $ N 
 <unk> <unk> at $ N a bottle sells out around the country and <unk> 's <unk> de champagne <unk> de <unk> is <unk> upon that level

 none of france 's wine regions can steal a march on <unk> however

 there are certain <unk> wines that can command these higher prices says larry shapiro of <unk> 's one of the largest wine shops in dallas 
 what 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out 
 we 're seeing it partly because older <unk> are growing more scarce 
 wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines mr. shapiro continued we 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the <unk> and <unk> which go for $ N to $ N a bottle 
 some of the newer wines even at $ N to $ N a bottle or so almost offer a bargain 
 take lake <unk> cabernet from diamond creek 
 it 's made only in years when the <unk> <unk> perfectly the last was N and comes from a single <unk> of <unk> that yielded a mere N cases in N 
 owner al <unk> originally planned to sell it for $ N a bottle but when a retailer in southern california asked is that wholesale or retail he <unk> the matter 
 offering the wine at roughly $ N a bottle wholesale $ N retail he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers N no the wine is too high N responses N yes it 's high but i 'll take it N responses N i 'll take all i can get N responses 
 the wine was shipped in <unk> cases instead of the usual N but even at that it was spread thin going to N retailers in N states 
 we thought it was <unk> expensive said sterling <unk> wine director at <unk> 's in <unk> ill. one of the top stores in suburban chicago but there are people out there with very different opinions of value 
 we got our two <unk> and they 're gone 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that he thinks <unk> prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on 
 even if there is consumer resistance at first a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move 
 there may be <unk> reaction initially said mr. <unk> but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the <unk> price to add it to their collection 
 it 's just sort of a <unk> thing with some people added larry shapiro 
 they like to talk about having the new red rock <unk> one of diamond creek 's <unk> or the dunn N cabernet or the <unk> 
 producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people 
 that explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly 
 but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago 
 they wo n't buy if the quality is not there said <unk> martin of martin wine <unk> in new orleans 
 or if they feel the wine is <unk> and they can get something equally good for less 
 mr. martin has increased prices on some wines like <unk> hills <unk> now $ N just to slow down movement but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the $ N to $ N range 
 image has of course a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't and it ca n't be forced 
 wine merchants ca n't keep <unk> <unk> in stock but they have to push salon <unk> <unk> even lowering the price from $ N to $ N 
 it 's hardly a question of quality the N salon is a beautiful wine but as mr. <unk> noted people have their own ideas about value

 the offer follows an earlier proposal by nl and mr. simmons to help georgia gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $ N a share

 criticism in the u.s. over recent japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations 
 officials from both nations say the u.s. public 's <unk> about japanese investment could color a second round of <unk> economic talks scheduled for next week in washington 
 not that washington and tokyo disagree on the japanese acquisitions indeed each has come out in favor of <unk> investment in the u.s. 
 where they disagree is on the subject of u.s. direct investment in japan 
 the u.s. wants the removal of what it <unk> as barriers to investment japan denies there are real barriers 
 the <unk> talk <unk> up by recent japanese investments in the u.s. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the <unk> talks known as the structural <unk> initiative 
 the japanese should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy says charles <unk> u.s. assistant treasury secretary who has been in tokyo this week <unk> discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders 
 we have a long history of maintaining an open <unk> policy mr. <unk> says 
 u.s. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment in japan 
 the japanese <unk> openly about the u.s. public 's <unk> 
 one clear sign of japan 's nervousness came this week when a spokesman for japan 's foreign ministry devoted nearly all of a regular half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent japanese investments in the u.s. 
 we believe that it is <unk> important for those japanese business interests in the u.s. to be more aware of the <unk> and concerns of the american people said the spokesman <unk> <unk> 
 at the same time though he <unk> the media for paying such close attention to japanese investment when other foreign countries notably britain are acquiring more american assets 
 fears that japanese investors are buying up america have <unk> sharply in the past several weeks with sony corp. 's purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc. from coca-cola co. and mitsubishi estate co. 's acquisition of a N N holding in rockefeller group the owner of some of <unk> manhattan 's most exclusive real estate 
 even before those moves added fuel the fires of <unk> had been well <unk> by the highly publicized experience in japan of one u.s. investor t. boone pickens jr 
 the texas <unk> has acquired a N N stake valued at more than $ N billion in an <unk> company <unk> manufacturing co 
 but he has failed to gain any influence at the company 
 <unk> has refused to grant mr. pickens seats on its board <unk> he is a <unk> trying to pressure <unk> 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit 
 mr. pickens made considerable political <unk> with his troubles in japan 
 the senate finance committee <unk> by a fellow <unk> democratic sen. lloyd <unk> last month urged u.s. trade representative carla hills to use mr. pickens 's experience in talks with tokyo to highlight this problem facing americans who seek access to the japanese capital markets 
 while mr. <unk> and japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the u.s. and japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks 
 among them are differences in savings and investment rates corporate structures and management and government spending 
 each side has a <unk> of recommendations for the other 
 the u.s. says it is anxious for results 
 we feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified and we need it by next spring mr. <unk> says 
 both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed 
 but they have n't <unk> what those might be 
 after the first set of meetings two months ago some u.s. officials complained that japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make 
 the japanese <unk> that the first round was too early to make concessions 
 just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything says a ministry of international trade and industry official 
 we need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it 
 that process of <unk> out <unk> is likely to take time the japanese say no matter how badly the u.s. wants quick results 
 for instance at the first meeting the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions 
 since then a team of about N <unk> and u.s. commerce department officials have crossed the globe <unk> consumer prices

 little by little there is progress says the <unk> official

 while worry grows about big japanese investments in the u.s. japan 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in america 's smaller business 
 for japan the controversial trend improves access to american markets and technology 
 but for small american companies it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help 
 take the deal with candela laser corp. a <unk> mass. manufacturer of high-tech medical devices which three years ago set its sights on japan as an export market 
 partly to help clear the <unk> obstacles facing any overseas company trying to <unk> japan tiny candela turned to mitsui & co. one of japan 's largest trading companies for investment

 it eventually secured ministry of health import approval for two candela laser products one that breaks up kidney stones and another that <unk> skin <unk> 
 at last count candela had sold $ N million of its medical devices in japan 
 the deal also gave mitsui access to a high-tech medical product 
 they view this as a growth area so they went about it with a <unk> approach says richard <unk> a candela vice president 
 indeed for many japanese trading companies the favorite u.s. small business is one whose research and development can be <unk> for future japanese use 
 the japanese companies <unk> many small u.s. companies with promising products or ideas frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch 
 japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized u.s. firms for years but in recent months the pace has taken off 
 in the first half of N alone japanese corporations invested $ N million in minority positions in u.s. companies a N N rise from the figure for all of N reports venture economics inc

 in addition of course some of the japanese investments involved outright purchase of small u.s. firms 
 heightened japanese interest in american small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving japanese companies control of large highly visible u.s. corporations such as columbia pictures entertainment inc 
 only this week it was announced that mitsubishi estate co. had acquired a N N stake in rockefeller group which owns new york 's prestigious rockefeller center 
 while the small deals are far less <unk> they add to japanese <unk> of the u.s. market

 it 's the classic problem of the small businessman says malcolm <unk> managing director of trading alliance corp. of new york 
 people are <unk> at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very <unk> 
 they want assets they want a balance sheet which has no <unk> to the business a company can generate 
 adds mitsui 's mr. <unk> unlike corporations in this country trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows 
 to the extent they can do this they 're quite content to get a return on investment of N N to N N 
 mr. <unk> says mitsui has N u.s. subsidiaries in which it holds N N interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its u.s. affiliates in N

 for N years <unk> <unk> went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient 
 a <unk> customer that banks <unk> for she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving nor to the fees she was paying 
 but in august first atlanta national bank introduced its crown account a package designed to lure customers such as ms. <unk> 
 among other things it included checking safe deposit box and credit card all for free plus a good deal on installment loans 
 all she had to do was put $ N in a certificate of deposit or qualify for a $ N personal line of credit 
 i deserve something for my loyalty she says 
 she took her business to first atlanta 
 so it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days 
 for nearly a decade banks have <unk> for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans 
 the competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services 
 but many banks are turning away from strict price competition 
 instead they are trying to build customer loyalty by <unk> their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population 
 you 're dead in the water if you are n't <unk> the market says anne moore president of <unk> research corp. a bank consulting firm in atlanta 
 ncnb corp. of charlotte n.c. recently introduced its financial connections program aimed at young adults just starting careers 
 the program not only offers a <unk> car loan up to $ N but throws in a special <unk> statement to help in saving money 
 in september union <unk> corp. of memphis tenn. launched the edge account a package designed for the <unk> crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees and a full percentage point off on installment loans 
 the theory such individuals many with young children are in their prime borrowing years and having borrowed from the bank they may continue to use it for other services in later years 
 for some time banks have been aiming packages at the elderly the <unk> segment with the highest savings 
 those efforts are being stepped up

 in N wells fargo & co. of san francisco launched the gold account which included free checking a credit card <unk> box and travelers checks for a $ N monthly fee 
 the concept <unk> a slew of <unk> but the banks stopped promoting the packages 
 one big reason thin margins 
 many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to <unk> and could n't target market <unk> that would have made the programs more profitable 
 as banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs 
 but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography 
 they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s 
 deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as <unk> cds 
 where a bank once offered a standard <unk> savings account it began offering money-market accounts certificates of deposit and <unk> checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits 
 the competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as <unk> corp. of minneapolis and chemical banking corp. of new york extend their market-share <unk> into small towns across the nation 
 today a banker is worrying about local regional and <unk> banks as well as thrifts and credit unions says ms. moore at <unk> research 
 so people who were n't even thinking about targeting N years ago are scrambling to define their customer base 
 the competition has <unk> a much <unk> consumer 
 the average household will spread N accounts over a dozen financial institutions says michael p. sullivan who runs his own bank consulting firm in charlotte n.c 
 this much <unk> makes attracting and keeping today 's <unk> customers costly 
 packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place 
 for their troubles the banks get a larger <unk> audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate 
 the more accounts customers have mr. sullivan says the more likely they are to be attracted to a package and to be loyal to the bank that offers it 
 that can pay off down the road as customers especially the younger ones change from borrowers to <unk> 
 packaging has some <unk> 
 the additional technology personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive 
 chemical bank spent more than $ N million to introduce its <unk> line several packages aimed at different segments in N according to thomas jacob senior vice president of marketing 
 it 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay mr. jacob says 
 still bankers expect packaging to <unk> primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs 
 these days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them ms. moore says 
 some banks are already moving in that direction according to alvin t. sale marketing director at first union corp. in charlotte 
 first union he says now has packages for seven customer groups 
 soon it will split those into N 
 says mr. sale i think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store not the <unk>

 as a foster corporate parent you will experience the same <unk> felt by robert bass lewis <unk> william simon and others who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves

 leo <unk> merc executive committee chairman said that the <unk> limit appeared to <unk> the selling panic oct. N

 at one point mr. phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman rep. edward markey d. mass. by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers 
 markey said we could have done this in public because so little sensitive information was disclosed the aide said 
 mr. phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel the aide added 
 at another point during the hearing rep. markey asked mr. phelan what would be discussed at a new york exchange board meeting today 
 mr. phelan said the big board is likely to study the program-trading issue 
 that response <unk> rep. markey house aides said and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter 
 <unk> of the N subcommittee members attended the hearing most notably rep. john dingell d. mich. the full house energy and commerce committee chairman who has been willing to let mr. markey carry the legislation in recent months 
 mr. dingell expressed concern sources said about <unk> problems in <unk> program trading which uses futures to offset stock trades 
 the futures industry is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission which reports to the agriculture committees in both houses 
 the art of <unk> is <unk> to the english and like most english <unk> <unk> to the rest of the world 
 <unk> l. <unk> the nine <unk> 
 <unk> england 
 of all scenes that <unk> rural england this is one of the <unk> an ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells <unk> from its tower calling the <unk> to <unk> 
 the <unk> of st. michael and all angels stop to <unk> at the church door as members here always have 
 in the tower five men and women pull <unk> on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in N 
 but there is also a <unk> modern note in <unk> though it ca n't be heard by the <unk> enjoying the <unk> of bells this cool autumn evening 
 like most of the other N <unk> in britain with sets of bells st. michael once had its own band of ringers who would herald every sunday morning and evening service 
 now only one local ringer remains <unk> <unk> hammond 
 the others here today live elsewhere 
 they belong to a group of N ringers including two <unk> and four youngsters in training who drive every sunday from church to church in a <unk> effort to keep the bells <unk> in the many <unk> of east <unk> 
 to ring for even one service at this tower we have to <unk> says mr. hammond a retired <unk> worker 
 we 've tried to train the youngsters but they have their <unk> and their <unk> and they just <unk> away 
 mr. hammond worries that old age and the <unk> of youth will <unk> the ranks of the east <unk> group that keeps the <unk> bells <unk> 
 history after all is not on his side 
 according to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of england 's church bells are no longer <unk> on <unk> because there is no one to ring them 
 it is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes 
 the less complicated version of playing <unk> on bells as do the <unk> of continental europe is considered by the english to be <unk> fit only for foreigners 
 <unk> a <unk> exercise the english invented N years ago requires physical <unk> some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration 
 proper english bells are started off in <unk> from the <unk> bell to the lowest a simple <unk> scale using in larger <unk> as many as N bells 
 then at a signal the ringers begin <unk> the order in which the bells sound without <unk> the steady <unk> of the striking 
 each <unk> or change can occur only once the rules state 
 ringers <unk> patterns of changes known as methods which have <unk> names like kent <unk> bob major or <unk> <unk> 
 a series of N or so changes is a <unk> and takes about three hours 
 a look at a thursday night practice at st. mary <unk> church in the <unk> district of london gives an idea of the work involved 
 ten <unk> ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a <unk> 's stance each pulling a <unk> that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber 
 no one speaks and the <unk> of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves <unk> by the ceiling 
 totally absorbed the ringers <unk> straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it <unk> to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls 
 far above in the <unk> the huge <unk> bells mounted on wheels swing <unk> through a full N degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the <unk> or <unk> position 
 skilled ringers use their <unk> to advance or <unk> the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change 
 in a well-known <unk> involving church bells english novelist <unk> l. <unk> described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in <unk> <unk> and mechanical <unk> 
 ringers she added are filled with the <unk> <unk> that comes of <unk> <unk> <unk> performed 
 ringing does become a bit of an <unk> admits <unk> <unk> master of the band at st. mary <unk> and one of england 's best female ringers 
 it is a passion that usually stays in the tower however 
 more often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the <unk> 
 when their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often <unk> off to the local <unk> leaving <unk> for others below 
 this does not sit well with some <unk> 
 with membership of the church of england steadily <unk> <unk> <unk> are pressing equally <unk> and often <unk> ringers to attend services 
 two years ago the rev. <unk> <unk> vicar of great <unk> <unk> got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he <unk> the entire band the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest 
 they were a <unk> club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the vicar <unk> says 
 an entirely new band <unk> today at great <unk> several of whom are members of the <unk> 
 but there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells 
 at st. mary 's church in <unk> <unk> the bells have fallen silent following a <unk> over church attendance 
 the vicar <unk> jones refuses to talk about it saying it would reopen the wound 
 but <unk> marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the <unk> from the bell tower that are located next to the <unk> 
 so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the <unk> is at <unk> he says 
 vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active <unk> himself 
 the sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church he says 
 i live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that <unk> life 
 the central council of church bell ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with <unk> says john c. baldwin president 
 it hopes to speak to students at <unk> colleges about the <unk> of bell ringing and will shortly publish a <unk> for every vicar in the country entitled the bells in your care 
 says mr. baldwin we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience 
 mr. baldwin is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers 
 one survey says that of the N trained <unk> in england today only N of them still ring 
 also ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be <unk> like in small rural <unk> and inner-city <unk> 
 but the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says mr. baldwin 
 right now we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of N he adds 
 one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once <unk> field more than a third of the ringers today are women 
 they are n't accepted everywhere however 
 the oldest <unk> group in the country the ancient society of college <unk> founded in N remains <unk> a fact that 's particularly <unk> to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for britain 's most prestigious <unk> st. paul 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 this being britain no woman has filed an <unk> suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to the ringing world a weekly newspaper for ringers 
 one writer signing his letter as <unk> balanced male <unk> on the frequency of women <unk> in <unk> and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings 
 in the <unk> of replies that followed one woman ringer from <unk> observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be <unk> badly dressed <unk> with <unk> and a large <unk> frequently <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> 
 another women wrote from <unk> to say that in her N years of ringing i have never known a lady to <unk> in the <unk> 
 i have seen one or two men die <unk> them 
 investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable <unk> of quarterly dividend checks 
 that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than N N 
 but do n't <unk> too easy those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn 
 in the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over 
 that can be a trap for <unk> investors says richard bernstein senior <unk> analyst at merrill lynch & co 
 strong dividend growth he says is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female <unk> that attract males and then kill them after <unk> 
 stephen boesel president of t. rowe price growth and income fund explains that companies raise their payouts most <unk> only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time 
 invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to <unk> environments he says 
 and <unk> environments are n't <unk> to the stock market 
 indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical <unk> 
 in N for example dividends on the stocks in standard & poor 's 500-stock index soared N N following much slower growth the year before 
 the s&p index started sliding in price in september N and fell N N in N despite a N N expansion in dividends that year 
 that pattern has n't always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious 
 payouts on the s&p N stocks rose N N in N according to standard & poor 's corp. and wall street estimates for N growth are generally between N N and N N 
 many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see double-digit gains continuing 
 meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag while dividends have risen <unk> their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices 
 as a result the market 's dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and <unk> by historical standards 
 put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say 
 they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the s&p N 
 the figure is currently about N N up from N N before the recent market slide 
 some analysts say investors should run for the <unk> if a sustained market rebound <unk> the yield below N N 
 a drop below that N N benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says mr. boesel of t. rowe price 
 in fact the market has always <unk> 
 always 
 there 's never been an exception says gerald w. <unk> a chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock-market data 
 the last time the s&p N yield dropped below N N was in the summer of N 
 stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the october debacle 
 there have been only seven other times in N N N N N N and N when the yield on the s&p N dropped below N N for at least two consecutive months mr. <unk> found 
 and in each case he says a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year 
 still some market analysts say the current N N reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past 
 it 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not <unk> in a traditional manner says james h. <unk> head of stock investments for cigna corp. the <unk> insurer 
 in particular mr. <unk> says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically 
 so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength 
 rather than increasing dividends some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares notes steven g. einhorn <unk> of the investment policy committee at goldman sachs & co 
 he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about N N 
 that is just a <unk> below the average of the past N years or so he says 
 what will happen to dividend growth next year 
 common wisdom suggests a <unk> rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits 
 painewebber inc. for instance is forecasting growth in s&p N dividends of just under N N in N down from an estimated N N this year 
 in other years in which there have been moderate economic <unk> the environment the firm expects in N the change in dividends ranged from a gain of N N to a decline of N N according to painewebber analyst thomas <unk> 
 the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial <unk> this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken 
 dividend growth on the order of N N is expected by both mr. <unk> of cigna and mr. einhorn of goldman sachs 
 those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures 
 one indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard & poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends 
 a total of N companies raised dividends in october basically unchanged from N a year ago s&p said wednesday 
 that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace 
 while the s&p tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further <unk> in the number of dividend increases could be a <unk> of slower dividend growth next year 
 in any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels 
 mr. einhorn of goldman sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a N N to N N total return from appreciation and dividends over the next N months vs. a cash rate of return of perhaps N N or N N if dividend growth is weak 
 but mr. boesel of t. rowe price who also expects N N growth in dividends next year does n't think it will help the overall market all that much 
 having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do n't think it 's a main consideration he says 
 with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels

 it was richard nixon 's first visit to china in N that set in motion the historic <unk> between beijing and washington 
 but the former u.s. president 's sixth visit to china during which he spoke at length with chinese leaders was nowhere near as successful at easing <unk> that have recently <unk> the <unk> relationship 
 mr. nixon the most prominent american to come to china since beijing 's bloody <unk> of pro-democracy demonstrators in june <unk> on international <unk> over the massacre 
 the chinese in turn took aim at american <unk> in china 's domestic affairs 
 one official newspaper legal daily even directly criticized mr. nixon who is normally referred to here as an old friend 
 the paper accused him of being a leading <unk> of peaceful evolution a catch phrase to describe what china believes is the policy of western countries to <unk> socialist nations into the capitalist <unk> 
 the tension was evident on wednesday evening during mr. nixon 's final <unk> <unk> normally an opportunity for <unk> <unk> about <unk> friendship 
 instead mr. nixon reminded his host chinese president <unk> <unk> that americans have n't <unk> china 's leaders for the military assault of june N that killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of demonstrators 
 many in the united states including many friends of china believe the crackdown was excessive and <unk> mr. nixon told mr. <unk> who was directly involved in ordering the attack 
 the events of april through june damaged the respect and confidence which most americans previously had for the leaders of china 
 the chinese responded in an equally <unk> fashion 
 in talks with mr. nixon chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings and even suggested that the u.s. was <unk> involved in the demonstrations this spring 
 in a meeting tuesday supreme leader deng <unk> told mr. nixon frankly speaking the u.s. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and <unk> <unk> which occurred in beijing not long ago 
 china was the real victim and it is <unk> to <unk> china for it 
 despite the harsh exchanges the u.s. and china still seem to be looking for a way to <unk> relations which have deteriorated into what mr. nixon referred to as the greatest crisis in <unk> relations since his initial visit to china N years ago 
 in his return <unk> to mr. nixon mr. <unk> said the relationship had reached a <unk>

 mr. nixon met mr. bush and his national security adviser <unk> scowcroft before coming to china on saturday 
 and he plans to brief the president at the end of the week u.s. sources said 
 mr. nixon was to leave china today 
 according to an american member of the nixon party the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his N hours of talks with <unk> chinese officials 
 these included china 's economic policies human rights and the question of mr. <unk> 
 mr. nixon also proposed that china restore its participation in the <unk> program a u.s. <unk> academic exchange 
 china pulled out of the program in july 
 in his talks the former president urged china 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the <unk> of outside contacts and ideas 
 ideas are going over borders and there 's no sdi ideological weapon that can shoot them down he told a group of americans at the u.s. embassy on wednesday 
 there are no signs however of china 's yielding on key issues 
 but in one minor matter mr. nixon appears to have gained a <unk> 
 in a meeting with premier <unk> <unk> on monday mr. nixon said that he hoped he would n't <unk> guards with machine guns during his visit to the u.s. embassy 
 sure enough when he arrived at the embassy two days later the <unk> guards were gone for the first time in five months 
 a few blocks away at the u.s. ambassador 's residence the guards <unk> the compound also had discarded their <unk> arms for the first time since early june 
 but the guards there retained their <unk> and a large contingent of <unk> police remained nearby in <unk> cars 
 moreover police and soldiers continue to <unk> americans who have filed several protests with the foreign ministry in the past week

 program traders are <unk> of predicting that if they are blocked in the u.s. they will simply <unk> to foreign stock markets 
 but in london and tokyo where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role traders say a number of hurdles <unk> 
 government officials especially in japan probably would resist any <unk> of program trading by players trying to <unk> off the u.s. furor over their activities and <unk> abroad with their business 
 japan is very concerned about the possible effects of program trading a senior japanese official said after the oct. N stock plunge in new york 
 u.s. stock-index futures are n't even traded in japan now 
 and because of the time difference the japanese and the u.s. markets ' trading hours do n't <unk> 
 it all adds up to a barrier to <unk> index arbitrage the most popular form of u.s. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in new york and the price of a futures contract in chicago based on those stocks 
 about N N of all program trading by new york stock exchange firms in september took place in foreign markets according to big board data 
 yet it is difficult to imagine japan racing to introduce <unk> stock-index futures 
 japan 's finance ministry already is <unk> institutional investors ' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading said <unk> utsumi vice minister for international finance 
 program trading has taken off in japan since last year 's introduction of <unk> stock-index futures trading on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges 
 but regulators are wary 
 they have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last dec. N when the first <unk> of <unk> index arbitrage drove stocks <unk> in the last half-hour of trading startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing 
 japan 's finance ministry had set up <unk> to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time 
 maybe it was n't enough a finance ministry official noted after the dec. N surge 
 japan 's regulators have since tightened controls on <unk> stock purchases 
 tokyo 's leading program traders are the big u.s. securities houses though the japanese are playing <unk> 
 some u.s. firms notably salomon inc. and morgan stanley group inc. have <unk> a hefty chunk of their japanese earnings from index arbitrage both for customers and for their own accounts

 the british also are <unk> program trades 
 index-arbitrage trading is something we want to watch closely an official at london 's stock exchange said 
 we do n't think there is cause for concern at the moment 
 london serves increasingly as a <unk> for program trading of u.s. stocks 
 market professionals said london has several <unk> 
 first the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the u.s. or london stock trading tapes 
 second it can be used to <unk> positions before u.s. trading begins but at prices pegged to the previous session 's big board close 
 in addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee 
 still much less index-arbitrage activity is done over here than in the u.s. said richard <unk> chief investment manager at standard life assurance co. which manages about # N billion $ N billion in united kingdom institutional funds

 the average number of ft-se option contracts traded on the london exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in N 
 this year the average of daily contracts traded totaled N up from N a year earlier and from N in N 
 but a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of <unk> trading was only N N of the size of the underlying equity market exchange officials said 
 this compares with estimates that the u.s. <unk> market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market 
 the house voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early N casting a solid N vote for a compromise measure backed by president bush 
 the vote came after a debate <unk> with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor 
 advocates said the <unk> rise to $ N an hour by april N is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs 
 but the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on tuesday by president bush and democratic leaders in congress after congressional republicans urged the white house to <unk> a bit from its previous resistance to compromise 
 so both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in N raising the wage to $ N an hour from $ N 
 under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to $ N next april 
 the senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it 
 there are no <unk> about this bill rep. pat williams d. <unk> said during house floor debate yesterday 
 but because it 's all we 've got i 'm going to vote for it 
 while the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average u.s. manufacturing wage the level of $ N an hour in N will still be less than N N of average factory pay mr. williams said 
 but rep. <unk> <unk> r. n.j instead praised the house 's acceptance of a new youth training wage a <unk> that gop <unk> have sought for many years 
 adopting a <unk> policy means getting beyond the nickel and <unk> of the minimum wage mrs. <unk> said 
 policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary to help <unk> job skills to <unk> into the work force 
 labor unions and democrats long fought the idea but recently <unk> to it in the face of bush administration insistence 
 the compromise sets the training wage at $ N an hour next april and at $ N an hour or N N of the minimum wage in april N 
 employers can pay the <unk> for N days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another N days if the company uses a <unk> training program for the young workers 
 the training wage covers only workers who are N to N years old 
 the white house previously insisted on an <unk> six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job 
 the u.s. chamber of commerce still opposed to any <unk> increase said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor N N in two stages between april N and april N will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for american workers and higher prices for american consumers

 for six years t. marshall hahn jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the george bush mode kind and <unk> 
 the question now can he act more like <unk> teddy <unk> 
 mr. hahn the <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of georgia-pacific corp. is leading the <unk> concern 's unsolicited $ N billion bid for great northern nekoosa corp 
 nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction mr. hahn has n't faced in his N earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes 
 so far mr. hahn is trying to <unk> nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough 
 we are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he says 
 but a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all that implies 
 if a competitor enters the game for example mr. hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival 
 given that choice associates of mr. hahn and industry observers say the former university president who has developed a reputation for not <unk> for anything would <unk> 
 there 's a price above which i 'm positive marshall has the <unk> not to pay says <unk> <unk> georgia-pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper 
 says <unk> associate jerry <unk> vice president corporate development at <unk> industries inc. he is n't of the old school of winning at any cost 
 he also is a consensus manager insiders say 
 the decision to make the bid for nekoosa for example was made only after all six members of georgia-pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal even though mr. hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on says mr. <unk> 
 associates say mr. hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of virginia <unk> institute 
 assuming that post at the age of N he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says warren h. <unk> a university official who is <unk> a book on mr. hahn 
 but he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand 
 in N mr. hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were <unk> a university building 
 that impressed robert b. <unk> georgia-pacific 's chief executive at the time whom mr. hahn had met while <unk> for the institute 
 in N mr. <unk> <unk> mr. hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals the move <unk> many in georgia-pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world 
 but mr. hahn rose swiftly through the ranks <unk> a raw intelligence that he says he knew he <unk> early on 
 the son of a <unk> mr. hahn <unk> first grade because his reading ability was so far above his <unk> 
 moving rapidly through school he <unk> <unk> beta <unk> from the university of kentucky at age N after spending only N N years in college 
 he earned his <unk> in nuclear physics from the massachusetts institute of technology 
 mr. hahn agrees that he has a <unk> memory but friends say that 's an <unk> 
 they call it photographic 
 mr. hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of georgia-pacific 
 taking over as chief executive officer in N he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a <unk> slide in its <unk> business 
 mr. hahn began selling <unk> businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals 
 he even sold one unit that made <unk> <unk> covers 
 at the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while <unk> building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for new-home construction 
 the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction 
 the formula has paid off so far 
 georgia-pacific 's sales climbed to $ N billion last year compared with $ N billion in N when mr. hahn took the reins 
 profit from continuing operations has soared to $ N million from $ N million 
 mr. hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best 
 the record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive he says 
 nekoosa would n't be a diversification 
 it would be a good match mr. hahn and many analysts say of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows 
 the resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ N billion 
 but can mr. hahn carry it off 
 in this instance industry observers say he is entering <unk> waters 
 says <unk> <unk> an analyst at first manhattan co. this is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced 
 a house-senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ N million in economic aid for poland that relies heavily on $ N million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal N in hopes of <unk> future trade and investment 
 for the agency for international development <unk> approved $ N million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the overseas private investment corp. are increased by $ N million over fiscal N as part of the same poland package 
 the conference approved at least $ N million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than $ N million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the bush administration 
 the agreement on poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the white house and is sharply confined under this year 's budget 
 these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the poland package and while more ambitious <unk> legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on u.s. aid to eastern europe 
 to accommodate the additional cash assistance the house appropriations committee last week was required to <unk> an estimated $ N million from the pentagon 
 and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in central america indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively 
 the action on poland came as the conference separately approved $ N million for international population planning activities an N N increase over fiscal N 
 the house and senate are divided over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant 
 in a second area of common concern the world environment an additional $ N million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the african elephant 
 the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a california <unk> museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of panama 's quota of exports to the profitable u.s. market 
 panama was stripped of this right because of u.s. differences with the noriega regime but the central american country would have received a quota of N metric tons over a <unk> period ending sept. N N 
 about a quarter of this share has already been <unk> according to the industry but the remaining N tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current u.s. price of N cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate 
 the potential sales are nearly $ N million and house majority whip william gray d. pa began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to <unk> countries of the caribbean such as jamaica and <unk> 
 rep. jerry lewis a conservative <unk> added a provision of his own intended to assist <unk> and the senate then <unk> the list further by including all countries in the u.s. caribbean basin <unk> as well as the philippines backed by the powerful hawaii democrat sen. daniel inouye 
 jamaica wary of <unk> its caribbean basin allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by mr. gray but the greater question is whether mr. inouye who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to <unk> a claim by the philippines 
 in separate floor action the house <unk> budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ N billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal N 
 the funding is attached to an estimated $ N billion transportation bill that goes next to the senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all u.s. domestic airline flights 
 the leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the white house but in recent days the senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the house 
 the most recent example was a nearly $ N billion fiscal N bill funding the state justice and commerce departments 
 and after losing a battle tuesday night with the senate foreign relations committee <unk> from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference 
 beauty takes <unk> to safety on bridges 
 everyone agrees that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced 
 but there 's disagreement over how to do it 
 highway officials insist the <unk> <unk> on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from <unk> through 
 but other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful sometimes historic features 
 the primary purpose of a <unk> is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a <unk> view says jack white a planner with the indiana highway department 
 he and others prefer to install <unk> such as the type f safety shape a <unk> concrete <unk> with no <unk> 
 in richmond ind. the type f <unk> is being used to replace <unk> <unk> on the <unk> street bridge 
 <unk> boone who teaches art at <unk> college calls the new structure just an <unk> bridge and one that blocks the view of a new park below 
 in hartford conn. the charter oak bridge will soon be replaced the <unk> <unk> from its <unk> <unk> to a park 
 <unk> are possible 
 citizens in peninsula ohio upset over changes to a bridge negotiated a deal the bottom half of the <unk> will be type f while the top half will have the old bridge 's <unk> pattern 
 similarly highway engineers agreed to keep the old <unk> on the key bridge in washington d.c. as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road
